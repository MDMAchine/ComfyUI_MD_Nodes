## 1. Introduction

### What is the PingPong Sampler?

The **PingPong Sampler (FBG)** is not a standard sampler; it is a *sampler provider*. It acts as an advanced "brain" that plugs into a standard KSampler node, hijacking its internal logic to provide a far more dynamic and controllable generation process. It enhances the denoising process in two key ways:

* **"Ping-Pong" Ancestral Noise Injection:** It employs a strategy of intelligently alternating between denoising your latent data and strategically re-injecting controlled ancestral noise. This is particularly beneficial for maintaining coherence in time-series data (like audio or video frames) and can introduce rich textures in static images.

* **Feedback Guidance (FBG):** This is the core innovation. Instead of a fixed guidance scale (CFG), FBG acts like an adaptive cruise control, dynamically adjusting the guidance strength based on the model's "certainty" at each step.

### Who is this Node For?

* **AI Musicians & Sound Designers:** Anyone generating audio who needs to push their models to the creative limit and achieve unique sonic textures.
* **Experimental Visual Artists:** Users who want to move beyond the "feel" of standard samplers and explore chaotic, highly-textured, or uniquely detailed image styles.
* **Workflow Tinkerers & Power Users:** Anyone who loves having deep control over the sampling process and wants to fine-tune every aspect of the generation.

### Key Features in Version 0.9.9-p2

* **Dynamic Feedback Guidance (FBG):** The intelligent, self-regulating guidance system that adapts to your model on the fly.
* **Advanced Ancestral Noise Control:** Go beyond simple noise injection with selectable noise types (`gaussian`, `uniform`, `brownian`) and precise scheduling.
* **Full Tuning Control:** A comprehensive suite of parameters allows you to switch between a powerful "Autopilot" mode and a precise "Manual" mode for FBG.
* **Conditional Blending:** Create complex "if/then" rules to change how the sampler behaves at different stages of the generation.
* **Multi-Level Debug Mode:** Get unparalleled insight into the sampler's internal state with a verbose console log to perfect your settings.
* **Full YAML Preset Support:** Define and save every single parameter in a portable YAML string for perfect reproducibility.

## 3. Core Concepts: The Art of Dynamic Sampling

### "Ping-Pong" Ancestral Noise: Creative Chaos

Standard samplers only remove noise. An ancestral sampler, like this one, re-injects a small, controlled amount of new noise at certain steps. This "ping-pong" between denoising and re-noising prevents the image from becoming overly smooth and can introduce beautiful, complex textures. You have full control over when this happens (`first/last_ancestral_step`) and what kind of noise is used (`ancestral_noise_type`).

### Feedback Guidance (FBG): The Intelligent Autopilot

Think of standard CFG as a simple cruise controlâ€”you set it to 7 and it stays there. FBG is an **adaptive cruise control**. It constantly measures the difference between what the model wants to do (unconditional) and what you told it to do (conditional).

* If the model is on the right track, FBG might lower the guidance to allow for more nuance.
* If the model starts to stray, FBG increases the guidance to steer it back.

This dynamic adjustment can lead to more detailed and coherent results than a fixed CFG value.

### Conditional Blending: "If/Then" Rules for Creativity

This is an advanced feature that lets you change the sampler's blending algorithm mid-generation. You can set up triggers, such as "if the noise level drops below 0.3" or "if the image changes by more than 20% in one step," and tell the sampler to switch to a different blend function. This allows for complex behaviors, like using a stable blend for the initial composition and a sharper one for the final details.

## 4. Node Setup and Workflow

### How to Use It: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Add the Node:** Add the `PingPong Sampler (Custom FBG)` node to your workflow.
2.  **Connect the Scheduler:** Connect a `KSamplerScheduler` node to the `scheduler` input. This is mandatory.
3.  **Configure the Sampler:** Adjust the parameters on the PingPong Sampler node to your liking. Use the "Masterclass in Tuning" section below to guide you.
4.  **Connect to KSampler:** Connect the `SAMPLER` output of the PingPong node to the `sampler` input of a standard `KSampler` node.
5.  **Configure KSampler:** Your KSampler still controls the main process: `model`, `positive`, `negative`, `latent_image`, `steps`, `seed`, and the base `cfg` value. The PingPong node will take this base `cfg` and modify it dynamically.
6.  **Queue Prompt:** Run the generation. If `debug_mode` is on, check your console to see the FBG system in action.

## 5. Parameter Deep Dive

### 5.1. Ping-Pong Specific Parameters

* **`step_random_mode`**: Controls how the seed changes for ancestral noise injection (`off`, `block`, `reset`, `step`).
* **`step_size`**: The interval used by `block` and `reset` modes.
* **`seed`**: A base seed for the sampler's internal randomness (often overridden by the KSampler's seed).
* **`first_ancestral_step` / `last_ancestral_step`**: The step range where "ping-pong" noise injection is active.
* **`ancestral_noise_type`**: The type of noise to inject (`gaussian`, `uniform`, `brownian`).
* **`start_sigma_index` / `end_sigma_index`**: The range of the sigma schedule to process.
* **`enable_clamp_output`**: If `True`, clamps the final latent to `[-1.0, 1.0]`.
* **`scheduler`**: **Required.** Connects a `KSamplerScheduler`.
* **`blend_mode`**: The function for blending the *denoised sample* with *new noise* during ancestral steps.
* **`step_blend_mode`**: The function for blending the *denoised sample* with the *previous latent* during non-ancestral steps.

### 5.2. Feedback Guidance (FBG) & Enhancement Parameters

* **`debug_mode`**: Console log verbosity (`0`: Off, `1`: Basic, `2`: Verbose).

## 6. A Masterclass in Tuning Feedback Guidance

This guide will walk you through the entire process of taming and tuning the FBG system. Our goal is to achieve a **stable and dynamic guidance curve**.



### 6.1. The Golden Rule: Disabling Autopilot ðŸ›‘

The sampler has two modes for its sensitivity: **Automatic** and **Manual**.

* **Automatic Mode (Autopilot):** If **either `t_0` or `t_1` is NOT `0`**, the system is in Autopilot. It will **IGNORE** any values you set for `fbg_temp` and `fbg_offset`.
* **Manual Mode:** If **BOTH `t_0` AND `t_1` are set to `0`**, Autopilot is disengaged. You now have full, direct control.

**The first step in any serious tuning process is to engage Manual Mode.**

### 6.2. The Troubleshooting Playbook

#### Symptom: Guidance Explodes to Max Value Instantly ðŸš€

If your `Guidance Scale (GS)` shoots to its maximum value in the first few steps, the system is too sensitive.

**Solution: The "Safe Mode" Reset**

We need to force the sampler into a state of maximum stability.

1.  **Engage Manual Mode** by setting `t_0` and `t_1` to `0`.
2.  **Apply Safe Start Settings** to desensitize the system.

Copy this "Safe Mode" `fbg_config` block into your YAML:

```yaml
fbg_config:
  # --- Step 1: Engage Manual Mode ---
  t_0: 0.0
  t_1: 0.0
  
  # --- Step 2: Apply Safe Start Settings ---
  initial_value: 2.0            # Start the internal state high for a safety buffer
  fbg_temp: 0.01                # Start with extremely low sensitivity
  fbg_offset: 0.0                 # Start with no baseline drift
  guidance_max_change: 1000.0   # Ensure the rate limiter is disabled
  
  # --- Your other personal settings go here ---
  pi: 0.65
  max_guidance_scale: 250.0
  # etc...
```

#### Symptom: Guidance is Stable but "Stuck" ðŸ§Š

If the `Guidance Scale (GS)` barely moves, our "Safe Mode" reset was successful, but the sensitivity is too low.

**Solution: Tuning the `fbg_temp` Dial**

With the sampler in Manual Mode, **`fbg_temp` is now your primary sensitivity dial.**

1.  **Make a big jump first.** Change `fbg_temp` from `0.01` to **`0.1`**.
2.  **Observe the log.** The guidance will likely start moving.
3.  **Fine-tune.** The perfect value is usually between your last two attempts. Try values like **`0.03`**, **`0.05`**, etc., until you see a smooth, gradual change.

### 6.3. Reading the Signs - Anatomy of a Perfect Log

After tuning, you should get a log that tells a story of a controlled, dynamic generation.

```
# LOG EXCERPT
Step 0: ... GS: 2.55 | Log Posterior mean: 2.0000  # Starts at initial values
Step 1: ... GS: 2.62 | Log Posterior mean: 1.2110  # GS rises, Posterior falls
...
Step 6: ... GS: 250.00| Log Posterior mean: -1.0458 # Final push to max guidance!
...
--- PingPongSampler FBG Summary ---
  Guidance Scale Min: 2.550
  Guidance Scale Max: 249.998
  Guidance Scale Avg: 38.988
---------------------------------
```

**What this log shows:**
* **Gradual Ramp-Up:** The GS doesn't explode. It climbs steadily.
* **The "Crescendo":** In the final step, the guidance pushes to its maximum. This is desired behavior, not an error.
* **Healthy Average:** The average guidance is moderate, proving the process was controlled.

By following this processâ€”**1. Engage Manual Mode, 2. Start with Safe Settings, 3. Tune the `fbg_temp` Dial**â€”you can achieve a perfect FBG curve for any model.

## 7. Practical Recipes & Use Cases

### Recipe 1: Stable & Controlled Image Generation

This recipe uses Manual Mode for a gentle, predictable result ideal for high-fidelity images.

```yaml
debug_mode: 1
sigma_range_preset: "Custom"
fbg_config:
  t_0: 0.0
  t_1: 0.0
  fbg_temp: 0.05
  fbg_offset: 0.0
  initial_value: 1.0
  pi: 0.5
  max_guidance_scale: 22.0
```

### Recipe 2: Aggressive & Experimental Audio Generation

This recipe uses Autopilot for a powerful, front-loaded guidance curve that is great for energetic audio.

```yaml
debug_mode: 2
sigma_range_preset: "All"
blend_mode: "a_only"
step_blend_mode: "b_only"
fbg_config:
  t_0: 0.7
  t_1: 0.4

```

### Recipe 3: The "Slow Burn" Finishing Kick

This recipe uses Autopilot but flips the controls to create a gentle start and a powerful finish, ideal for complex compositions.

```yaml
debug_mode: 1
sigma_range_preset: "All"
fbg_config:
  t_0: 0.3 # Target is early
  t_1: 0.7 # Peak is late
  pi: 0.65
  max_guidance_scale: 30.0
```

## 8. Technical Deep Dive

### The Order of Operations

1.  **Parse & Override:** The node reads its UI parameters, then overrides them with any valid settings from the `yaml_settings_str`.
2.  **Instantiate Core:** The `PingPongSamplerCore` class is created.
3.  **Check FBG Mode:** It checks if `t_0` and `t_1` are both zero.
    * If **NO**, it enters **Autopilot** and calculates `temp` and `offset` automatically.
    * If **YES**, it enters **Manual Mode** and uses the `fbg_temp` and `fbg_offset` you provided.
4.  **Loop per Step:** For each sampling step, it...
    * Calculates the dynamic guidance scale using the FBG logic.
    * Calls the model to get a denoised prediction.
    * Updates its internal `log_posterior` state based on the model's feedback.
    * Performs the "Ping-Pong" or standard DDIM-like step using the selected blend modes.
5.  **Return:** After all steps, it returns the final latent.

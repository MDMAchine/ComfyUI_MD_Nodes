## 3. Core Concepts: The Audio Processing Chain

### Audio Normalization: Peak vs. RMS

Normalization is the process of adjusting audio volume to a standard level. AAPS offers two professional methods:

* **Peak Normalization:** This is the simplest method. It finds the single loudest point (the "peak") in your audio and turns the entire volume up or down so that this peak hits a target level (usually just below the maximum to avoid distortion). It's great for making sure nothing clips, but it doesn't guarantee the audio will *sound* consistently loud.
* **RMS Normalization:** This method measures the **average** volume (Root Mean Square) of the audio and adjusts it to a target. This is much closer to how humans perceive loudness. It's the professional standard for making different songs, dialogue clips, or sound effects sound like they belong together.

### The Soft Limiter: Preventing Distortion

When you boost the volume (especially with RMS normalization), some individual peaks might be pushed beyond the maximum digital level (0 dBFS). A simple "clamp" would just chop these peaks off, creating a harsh, ugly clicking distortion.

A **limiter** is a smarter tool. It acts like an ultra-fast, transparent volume knob that automatically turns down any sound about to distort, preserving the sound quality. **It is highly recommended to keep `use_limiter` enabled when using RMS normalization.**

### Metadata Embedding: Archiving Your Workflow

One of the most powerful features of ComfyUI is reproducibility. The AAPS node can embed the entire workflow (the arrangement of nodes and their settings) directly into the metadata of the saved FLAC, MP3, or OPUS file.

This means you can simply drag and drop the saved audio file back into ComfyUI in the future, and it will load the exact workflow that created it. This is invaluable for archiving your work or sharing your process. The `save_metadata` toggle gives you full privacy control.

### Finishing Touches: Fades & Mono Conversion

* **Fades:** Abrupt starts and stops can sound jarring. The `fade_in_ms` and `fade_out_ms` controls allow you to apply smooth volume ramps to the beginning and end of your audio for a polished, professional finish.
* **Mono Conversion:** Some applications require a single-channel (mono) audio file. The `channel_mode` option allows you to instantly downmix your stereo audio to mono.

## 4. Node Setup and Workflow

### How to Use It: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Connect Audio Source:** Connect the `AUDIO` output from your audio generation node (e.g., a VAE Decode for audio) to the `audio_input` of the AAPS node.
2.  **Set Filename and Format:**
    * Enter a name in `filename_prefix`. You can use date/time codes like `MySong_%Y%m%d`.
    * Select `MP3`, `FLAC`, or `OPUS` from the `save_format` dropdown.
3.  **Choose Processing Options:**
    * Set your desired `normalize_method`. If using `RMS`, set the `target_rms_db` (e.g., -14 for music, -18 for dialogue).
    * Keep `use_limiter` enabled for best results with RMS.
    * Set `fade_in_ms` or `fade_out_ms` if needed.
4.  **Enable Saving:** Check the `save_to_disk` box to save the file. If this is unchecked, the node will still process the audio and generate the waveform, but it won't write a file.
5.  **Connect Outputs (Optional):**
    * The `AUDIO` output passes through the *original, unprocessed* audio. You can connect this to an "Audio Preview" node for an A/B comparison.
    * The `WAVEFORM_IMAGE` output can be connected to a "Save Image" node to save the visualization.
6.  **Queue Prompt:** After running, the node's UI will display the path to the saved file for easy access.

## 6. Practical Recipes & Use Cases

### Recipe 1: Finalizing Music for Consistent Volume

Goal: Save a generated music track so it has a standard, competitive loudness without distortion.

* **`save_format`**: `FLAC` (for mastering) or `MP3` (for sharing)
* **`mp3_quality`**: `V0`
* **`fade_in_ms`**: `100` (for a subtle fade-in)
* **`fade_out_ms`**: `2000` (for a 2-second fade-out)
* **`normalize_method`**: `RMS`
* **`target_rms_db`**: `-14` (a common target for music streaming)
* **`use_limiter`**: `True` (Essential to catch peaks)
* **`save_to_disk`**: `True`

### Recipe 2: Quick Preview & Visualization (No Save)

Goal: Quickly check the audio and see its waveform without cluttering your output folder.

* **`save_to_disk`**: `False`
* All other settings can be left at their defaults. The node will still process the audio and output the waveform image, which you can preview.

### Recipe 3: Archiving a Generative Audio Workflow

Goal: Save a sound effect losslessly and ensure you can recreate it perfectly later.

* **`save_format`**: `FLAC` (lossless is key for archives)
* **`filename_prefix`**: `SoundEffect_AlienShip_%Y%m%d`
* **`save_metadata`**: `True`
* **`custom_notes`**: `Generated with custom XYZ model at 0.8 CFG. This version has a nice metallic texture.`
* **`normalize_method`**: `Peak` (to prevent clipping without altering dynamics)
* **`save_to_disk`**: `True`

## 7. Technical Deep Dive

### The Order of Operations

Understanding the sequence of events is key to predicting the final output. The node processes the audio in this specific order:

1.  **Channel Conversion:** The audio is first converted to mono, if selected.
2.  **Fades:** Fade-in and fade-out ramps are applied next.
3.  **Normalization:** The volume is adjusted using the selected Peak or RMS method. This happens *after* fades.
4.  **Limiter:** The limiter is the very last step in the audio chain, catching any peaks that were pushed too high by the normalization stage.
5.  **Saving & Encoding:** This processed audio is then sent to the encoder (`PyAV`) to be written to a file.

The audio sent to the `AUDIO` output port is the **original, unprocessed audio**, allowing for direct comparison with the processed version you hear in the saved file.

## 8. Troubleshooting & FAQ

* **"My audio sounds distorted or has clicking noises."**
    * This is almost always digital clipping. Ensure `use_limiter` is set to `True`. If you are using RMS normalization with a high `target_rms_db` (e.g., -8), you may be pushing the audio too hard. Try a lower value like -14.
* **"The limiter option is on, but it's not working."**
    * This feature requires the `pedalboard` library. It should have been installed automatically from the package's `requirements.txt` file. Check your ComfyUI console for any errors during startup related to `pedalboard` or missing packages. If it failed, you may need to run `pip install -r path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI_MD_Nodes/requirements.txt` manually and restart.
* **"I can't find my saved audio file."**
    * By default, files are saved in `ComfyUI/output/ComfyUI_AdvancedAudioOutputs/`. The node will also display the relative path of the saved file in its UI after it finishes running.
* **"My filename has `_2025-08-28` in it, why?"**
    * The default `filename_prefix` uses `strftime` codes (`%Y-%m-%d`) to automatically insert the current year, month, and day. You can change this to a static name or use other codes like `%H` (hour) and `%M` (minute).
* **"Why does the audio from the output port sound different from my saved file?"**
    * This is by design! The `AUDIO` output port passes through the **original, unprocessed audio** so you can use a Preview node to hear the "before" version. The saved file contains the "after" version with all your processing (fades, normalization, etc.) applied.

[Verse 1] {Night bleeds in through shattered screens,
A static ghost behind my eyes.
Your echo hums in the dial tone,
A phantom voice I can't disown.|The asphalt cracks with sickly weeds,
A final, broken, dying seed.
The wind it whispers through a rusted frame,
A world that can't remember its own name.|The sheets are cold where you once used to be,
A hollow space that's swallowing me.
I trace the outline of your empty space,
A memory I cannot erase.|It's 4 AM, the city holds its breath,
A hollow silence, cold and dark as death.
The clock is ticking, mocking me again,
The start of something, or the bitter end?|The login's just another hit I chase,
The only way to leave this dying place.
My flesh is just a prison I ignore,
I'm knocking on a non-existent door.|I'm scrolling through a feed of curated lies,
A thousand perfect, empty, smiling eyes.
It's just another drug to kill the pain,
A hollow static in my brain.|The pre-dawn light is cold and grey and thin,
A cruel reminder of the state I'm in.
I haven't slept, I'm watching shadows crawl,
Across the water stains upon the wall.|The factory smokestack breathes a final sigh,
Beneath a bruised and chemical-soaked sky.
This city is a cage of steel and rust,
And everyone we loved has turned to dust.|The bottle's empty, rolling on the floor,
I'm locking every single bolted door.
The moon is just a cold, indifferent eye,
And I am too worn out to cry.|I trace your face on a data-streaked screen,
The perfect ghost inside a dead machine.
Your voice is just a glitch, a fractured sound,
Lost in the code I found.|The concrete cracks where nothing ever grows,
A bitter lesson that the silence knows.
We walk through shells of what was there before,
A broken, rusted, open door.|Your name is still a ghost inside my phone,
A constant ache I feel when I'm alone.
I scroll back through the lines of blue and white,
And lose myself again into the night.|The walls are breathing, slow and deep and low,
A secret rhythm, nowhere else to go.
The shadows dance like something's trying to speak,
A language for the broken and the weak.|The pharmacist, he knows me now by name,
Another refill for the endless shame.
It doesn't fix the problem, just the sound,
And keeps my feet from leaving solid ground.|I trace the cracks upon the bedroom ceiling,
A roadmap to this empty, hollow feeling.
The promises I made are turning rust,
And all my resolutions turn to dust.|This cheap apartment is a concrete tomb,
The air is thick with failure and perfume.
I'm just a ghost inside a life I built,
A monument of memory and guilt.|The streetlights cast a sickly orange glow,
On empty streets where no one ever goes.
The autumn chill, it cuts me to the bone,
It's Wednesday night, and I am all alone.|This avatar, this skin, it feels so tight,
A cybernetic god in my own right.
But the batteries are running low,
And there is nowhere left for me to go.|The city's pulse is just a fever dream,
The circuits bursting at the very seam.
I search for something real I can hold on to,
In this world of glass and artificial blue.|The neon flickers on the rain-soaked street,
A broken rhythm, a corrupted beat.
The download stalls at ninety-nine percent,
Another dollar borrowed, never spent.|My reflection glitches in the bathroom mirror,
A stranger's face is getting clearer and clearer.
The medication dulls the sharper edges down,
But I'm still drowning in this ghost-filled town.|The server room hums like a dying prayer,
Cooling fans breathing stale, recycled air.
I'm just a username in a database,
A numbered entry in a hollow space.|The radiator clanks its iron song,
A reminder I've been here too long.
The paint is peeling like a second skin,
Revealing all the rot that lies within.|Your photographs are pixelating now,
A broken promise and a broken vow.
The resolution drops with every year,
Until you finally disappear.|I'm staring at the cursor as it blinks,
Another glass, another thirty drinks.
The bandwidth throttles down to almost nil,
And I'm just sitting here against my will.|The subway screams beneath the street,
A metal dragon, obsolete.
I ride it to the last forgotten stop,
Where all the broken people seem to drop.|The laundromat at 3 AM,
Just me and a few hollow men.
Our clothes spin cycles, round and round,
The only motion, the only sound.|I'm buffering between the world and sleep,
The loading screen is running way too deep.
My cache is full of things I can't delete,
A corrupted file on repeat.|The television bathes the room in blue,
A thousand channels, none of them are true.
I'm flipping through the static and the snow,
Looking for a place I used to know.|My laptop burns against my hollow chest,
A failed attempt to find some kind of rest.
The wifi signal's fading in and out,
Like my conviction, like my doubt.|The morning paper lands against the door,
With news of some forgotten, distant war.
I leave it there, I cannot bear to read,
Another manufactured, hollow need.|The coffee maker sputters, chokes, and dies,
Another small appliance that tries.
To keep me functioning, to keep me here,
In this apartment full of empty fear.|Your ghost is in the server logs somewhere,
A timestamp showing you were really there.
But now you're just corrupted memory,
A 404 inside of me.|The fire escape is rusting in the rain,
Another monument to slow decay and pain.
I climb out just to feel the cold night air,
And wonder if I'm really anywhere.|The billboard advertises perfect lives,
While down below, nobody survives.
We're all just extras in somebody's dream,
A background render in a breaking seam.|My phone is full of messages unread,
From people who think I might be dead.
I let them pile up like digital snow,
Because there's nothing left that they should know.|The circuit breaker trips at 2 AM,
Plunging me into the dark again.
I sit there in the sudden, total black,
Wondering if I want the power back.|Your social media is a curated lie,
A highlight reel I can't help but spy.
You're happy now, or that's what filters say,
While I'm still stuck in yesterday.|The thermostat is broken, stuck on cold,
This apartment makes me feel so old.
The heating system gave up years ago,
Like everything else I used to know.|I'm doom-scrolling through the endless night,
My eyes are burning from the harsh blue light.
The algorithm knows me better than I know myself,
A product on a server shelf.|The neighbors fight behind the paper walls,
Their voices echo through these hollow halls.
I press my ear against the painted plaster,
A witness to another small disaster.|The smoke detector chirps its low-battery song,
A reminder I've been neglecting things too long.
I pull it down and rip the wires free,
One less thing that's monitoring me.|Your playlist haunts my shuffle mode,
Every song's a heavy payload.
I can't bring myself to delete your name,
From this soundtrack of digital shame.|The elevator's broken once again,
I take the stairs through layers of my pain.
Each floor's a year I'm climbing back through time,
To when I thought that you were mine.|My prescription bottle rattles like a prayer,
A chemical communion for despair.
The pills don't fix me, they just mute the sound,
Of all the cracks that spider through the ground.|The streetlight's buzzing drives me half-insane,
A neon mantra of electric pain.
It flickers morse code messages at me,
In a language only broken people see.|I'm typing passwords that no longer work,
To accounts of who I used to be, a quirk.
Each "incorrect" is just another sign,
That I left myself behind.|The microwave is humming its death rattle,
I'm too tired for this domestic battle.
I eat cold soup straight from the rusted can,
The diet of a hollow man.|Your voicemail's still saved on my phone,
A ghost recording, I'm not alone.
I play it just to hear you say my name,
Before you left, before the shame.|The cable box is blinking twelve o'clock,
A monument to time I didn't watch.
The hours pass unmarked and undefined,
Just static in my mind.|I'm standing in the shower in the dark,
The water's cold, I've missed my mark.
I can't remember if I've been in here for hours,
Or if I still possess these powers.|The postal worker knows to skip my door,
I haven't checked my mail in weeks or more.
The bills pile up like leaves in early fall,
Another system's slow and bitter sprawl.|Your key is still here on my cluttered desk,
A relic of a failed domestic quest.
I should return it, close the final loop,
But I'm still caught up in this feedback group.|The carbon monoxide detector's dead,
Like so many things inside my head.
I wonder if the silence means I'm safe,
Or if I'm slowly dying in this place.|I'm watching dust motes dance in amber light,
These tiny worlds that only shine at night.
They swirl like galaxies of minor debris,
A universe as pointless as me.|The faucet drips its metronomic beat,
A reminder that I've been here on repeat.
I've counted every drop a thousand times,
Converting water into bitter rhymes.}

[Pre-Chorus] {The signal's fading, you're breaking apart,
A lossy compression of my heart.|I'm reaching through the noise to find your hand,
But I'm grasping at corrupted data strands.|The connection's weak, the latency is high,
Between the truth and every single lie.|I'm defragging memories I should let go,
But the deletion fails, the process is too slow.|The firewall's down, I'm vulnerable again,
To the virus of your memory and pain.|My antivirus can't quarantine this ache,
It's baked into my system, no escape.|The kernel's panicking, about to crash,
My stable self reduced to digital trash.|I'm pressing refresh, but nothing ever loads,
Just spinning circles on these empty roads.|The cache is full of you, it's overflow,
But clearing it means losing what I know.|My hard drive's failing, sectors going bad,
The architecture of everything I had.|I'm running out of storage, out of space,
To hold the ghost files of your face.|The backup failed, corrupted from the start,
Now I can't restore my broken heart.|I'm scanning for solutions, but they're gone,
Just trojans hiding in the break of dawn.|The motherboard is warping from the heat,
Of all this processing I can't complete.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Send me a glass signal,
Break through the noise, make it visceral.
I'm tuned to the dark inside of you,
A low-wave solace, cutting through.|We are the children of the rust,
Our broken idols turned to dust.
We're waiting for a sign the world forgot,
The only future that we've got.|This hollow ache, a cavern deep and wide,
The place where all my good intentions died.
I'm just a vessel for a burning ghost,
The one I loved the most.|Oh, the static in this hollow sound,
My feet are heavy on the solid ground.
I'm lost inside a loop I can't escape,
A broken mind that's lost its shape.|This simulation is a dirty drug,
A warm, immersive, all-consuming hug.
It's killing me, the bandwidth's running low,
But it's the only place I have to go.|You're just a ghost, a promise I misread,
A hollow comfort for a heart that's bled.
I'm done with chasing phantoms in the code,
It's time to lighten this destructive load.|It wasn't false, it wasn't just a lie,
Beneath this bleeding, simulated sky.
The feelings that we had were raw and true,
The only real thing was me and you.|So let the data rot, the server burn,
It's the one and only lesson that I'll learn.
That love can bloom in code and static hum,
And I will stay here 'til the end has come.|A cyber-rapture, flesh and wire entwine,
This broken hard-drive is a holy shrine.
Your voice is scripture in the static's hiss,
A perfect, final, digital abyss.|We are the last two gods of this dead place,
A universe collapsing in this space.
There's nothing left but noise and you and me,
In this beautiful, corrupting ecstasy.|So feed the hunger, kill the lights, and run,
Pretend the damage isn't already done.
We're just a sad cliché, a burned-out star,
Pretending we're not who we really are.|Send me a wavelength through the void,
The only signal not destroyed.|I'm tuned to your frequency alone,
In this abandoned radio zone.|We're amplitude modulated souls,
Static filling up the holes.|The carrier wave's been compromised,
Our signal's destabilized.|I'm receiving you in bursts of light,
Morse code through the endless night.|The noise floor's rising, drowning you,
Soon there'll be just static through and through.|I'm boosting gain but losing clarity,
This broken signal's my reality.|We're clipping, distorting at the peaks,
This channel's springing fatal leaks.|I'm compressing down the dynamic range,
Trying to preserve what's left of our exchange.|The interference pattern's beautiful,
These broken waves are bountiful.|We're creating standing waves of pain,
An endless, resonant, feedback chain.|I'm modulating between loss and you,
These waveforms show me what is true.|The spectrum analyzer shows the truth,
The frequencies we lost in youth.|We're out of phase, we're canceling out,
Destructive interference, full of doubt.|I'm filtering but losing tone,
Each cut leaves me more alone.|The sideband's all that's left of us,
Harmonics filled with rust and dust.|I'm demodulating memories,
Extracting signal from the debris.|We're red-shifting, moving apart,
Doppler effect on a breaking heart.|The oscilloscope displays our end,
A flat line that will not ascend.|I'm saturating, hitting the rails,
Every system finally fails.|We're sum and difference, beat and phase,
Lost inside the analog haze.|The signal-to-noise ratio's shot,
Can't tell between what is and what's not.|I'm listening for the carrier tone,
But I'm pretty sure I'm all alone.}

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2] {Your key is still here on my cluttered desk,
A relic of a failed domestic quest.
I should return it, close the final loop,
But I'm still caught up in this feedback group.|I'm scrolling through a feed of curated lies,
A thousand perfect, empty, smiling eyes.
It's just another drug to kill the pain,

Beneath a bruised and chemical-soaked sky.

A reminder that I've been here on repeat.
I've counted every drop a thousand times,
Converting water into bitter rhymes.|The construction site next door works all night long,
Heavy machinery's breaking, violent song.
They're tearing something down to build it new,
While I'm still stuck on losing you.|I'm standing at the window watching rain,
Each drop a tiny, separate pain.
They race each other down the dirty glass,
While I wait for this feeling to pass.|Your birthday's coming up on my phone's alert,
A digital reminder that still hurts.
I've deleted it probably fifty times,
But the memory persists between the lines.|The gym membership I never use,
Another monthly automated bruise.
They charge my card while I sit here and rot,
Paying for a body that I've forgot.|I'm reading through our old text history,
Each word's a little digital mystery.
When did we start to fall apart? Which message was the crucial start?|The library's full of books I'll never read,
Instructions for a life I'll never lead.
I wander through the stacks in desperate hope,
That somewhere here's a better way to cope.|The mechanic called, my car is done,
But I never took it in, that conversation never begun.
Another voicemail I invented in my mind,
Another symptom of the unraveling design.|I'm composing texts I'll never send,
Apologies that will never mend.
They pile up in my drafts like snow,
A cemetery of words you'll never know.|The fortune from my Chinese takeout,
Says "Better days ahead" but I have doubt.
I crumple it and throw it with the trash,
Where all my optimism tends to crash.|Your mom still sends me Christmas cards each year,
I think she doesn't know that we're not here.
I can't bring myself to tell her that we're through,
That I've lost any right to news of you.|The notification sound still makes me jump,
My heart rate spikes, my stomach turns to lump.
But it's never you, it's just the machine,
Pretending that we're still part of this scene.|I'm wearing clothes I wore when we were good,
Trying to return to how I once stood.
But they don't fit the person I've become,
Just fabric stretched on someone numb.|The fortune teller at the strip mall sees,
My desperate future in her dusty pleas.
She tells me love is coming very soon,
But I'm still howling at your missing moon.|I found the ticket stub from our first date,
Preserved like evidence of happier fate.
The movie's title's faded now to grey,
Like every single word I meant to say.|Your Netflix is still logged in on my TV,
A small invasion of your privacy.
I see what you've been watching late at night,
And wonder if you're sleeping alright.|The church bells ring on Sunday afternoon,
A mournful, distant, slightly out-of-tune.
Reminder of a faith I never had,
In a world that's mostly just sad.|I'm counting ceiling tiles to fall asleep,
One, two, three hundred sheep.
But your face interrupts at number ten,
And I have to start all over again.|The food delivery driver knows my door,
I tip too much, I'm ordering more and more.
Too tired to cook, too tired to care,
I'm slowly vanishing into thin air.|Your shampoo bottle's still here in the shower,
I've preserved it like some sacred tower.
It's been empty for probably two years,
But I can't throw away these bottled tears.|The spam calls come at 3 PM each day,
Asking for a person who moved away.
I let them ring, I never answer back,
Another soul lost in the digital crack.|I'm playing games I bought and never started,
Downloaded when we first got parted.
Hundreds of hours of escape I never used,
Just more proof I'm confused.|Your handwriting on a Post-it note,
On my fridge, some shopping list you wrote.
The ink is fading but I can still see,
The casual way you wrote "remember me".|The fire alarm goes off from burnt toast again,
A small disaster that's become my friend.
I wave a towel beneath the shrieking sound,
Another way I'm slowly breaking down.|I'm listening to podcasts while I pace,
White noise to fill the empty space.
I don't retain a single word they say,
Just need something to fill the day.|Your perfume bottle's still here beside my bed,
I spray it sometimes on the sheets instead.
Close my eyes and try to resurrect,
The ghost of something I can't resurrect.|The building's fire escape is my refuge now,
I smoke out there though I don't know how.
I started just to have something to do,
Another bad habit to replace you.|I'm doom-scrolling through apartment listings,
In cities where I have no business visiting.
Fantasizing about a fresh new start,
But you can't outrun a broken heart.|Your college sweatshirt's become my uniform,
Too big on me, but worn and warm.
I wear it 'til it's oil-stained and torn,
A comfort costume, weathered and worn.|The self-checkout judge my purchases,
Lean Cuisines and frozen promises.
"Unexpected item in bagging area",
Yes, my life is a continuous error.}

[Bridge] {Caught between the pulse and fade,
Where every soft-lit memory frays.
Your voice, a glitch we couldn't erase,
Still echoing in empty space.|We hold our breath and wait for the collapse,
A brief and terrible 'perhaps'.
We are the rust, we are the slow decay,
The ones who threw the whole wide world away.|Was any of it real, was any of it true?
The person that I thought I saw in you?
Or was I just a stop along your way?
The biggest, stupidest cliché.|The morning's coming, but it brings no light,
Just a different, colder shade of night.
My own reflection is a stranger's face,
A haunted vessel in a haunted place.|I'm not afraid of dying in the end,
I'm not afraid of breaking, I just bend.
I'm just afraid this all is not quite real,
And there's no solid ground beneath my heel.|I'd rather be a ghost with you right here,
Than face the living in a world of fear.
Your hand is glitching, phasing out of mine,
The last, corrupted, beautiful design.|We built our world on promises of sand,
And held an ocean in our hopeful hand.
We watched the tide come in and wash it clean,
The saddest, final, silent, closing scene.|Remember when we dared to dream?
Before the circuits blew a seam?
Now who can save us from this light That burns so beautiful and bright? We let reality dissolve like rain,
And now we're lost in here again.|Is this the punchline of a cosmic joke?
The fragile, final word that no one spoke?
A hollow orbit 'round a dying sun,
The race is over, and nobody won.
There is no meaning, there is no grand plan,
Just the pathetic, hollow fall of man.|I'm begging for a single hour's sleep,
From promises that I could never keep.
The morning's coming, but it brings no light,
Just a different shade of endless night.
My own reflection is a stranger's face,
A haunted vessel in a haunted place.|Did I ever love you? Or just the icon on the screen?
The perfect, curated, filtered, flawless dream?
I'm in love with just a ghost I helped create,
A digital and empty twist of fate.|What's the difference? The real world's just as cruel,
A different master, just a different set of rules.
At least in here, the sky is what I choose,
And I have nothing left to lose.|Maybe we were never meant to last,
Just a glitch between the future and the past.
A beautiful accident of code gone wrong,
A temporary, tragic, broken song.|I'm standing at the threshold, can't decide,
Which version of myself has truly died.
The one who loved you, or the one before,
The one who'll walk through yet another door.|The architecture of my mind's collapsed,
Between the future and the relapsed.
I'm building new rooms from the rubble and ash,
Hoping this time I won't crash.|Were you my savior or my slow descent?
An angel or a beautiful torment?
I'm analyzing data from the wreck,
Trying to salvage something from the deck.|The boundary between us has dissolved,
Every question left unsolved.
We're bleeding into each other's space,
No distinction left to trace.|I'm caught between forgiveness and despair,
Between the weight and the air.
Between the person that I was with you,
And whoever I'm becoming, someone new.|The liminal space between sleep and wake,
Is where I go to watch us break.
Frame by frame in slow decay,
Watching love evaporate away.|Sometimes I think I see the pattern clear,
The algorithm of why we're not here.
But then it shifts and changes in the light,
And I'm blind again, wandering in the night.|We were two functions that never should have merged,
Two separate programs that eventually diverged.
The compatibility was always just a lie,
A user error neither questioned why.|I'm standing on the edge of letting go,
But I don't trust the ground below.
What if there's nothing past this pain?
What if I'm never whole again?|The myths we told ourselves are coming clean,
The fantasy versus the real between.
I'm learning how to separate the two,
The person from the dream of you.|I'm recompiling everything I knew,
Debugging the story of me and you.
Somewhere in the code there's a fatal flaw,
Something fundamental that I never saw.|The sunset's just refracted light and gas,
There's no magic to it as it passes.
But we convinced ourselves that it was more,
That beauty meant something at the core.|I'm questioning the premise of it all,
Whether rising was worth the fall.
If emptiness is all that waits ahead,
Maybe I should have stayed in bed.|But something's shifting in the breaking dawn,
A tiny signal that says "carry on".
Not hope exactly, more like survival's call,
The stubborn instinct not to fall.|Maybe meaning's not something that you find,
But something broken people build in their mind.
A structure raised from nothing but belief,
A way to metabolize the grief.|I'm learning how to breathe in this new air,
Heavy with the absence of your care.
Each breath a small rebellion, a tiny fight,
Against the gravity of night.|The system's rebooting, slow and cold,
Loading up a self I barely hold.
I don't know this version of me yet,
But I'm the only thing I've got.|I'm factory resetting my own mind,
Trying to leave the malware behind.
Returning to some earlier restore point,
Before the system fell out of joint.|The damage may be permanent, it's true,
The before and after of loving you.
But maybe damaged things can still persist,
Find a way to coexist.|I'm fragmenting into parallel threads,
Running different futures in my head.
In one I'm fine, in one I'm not,
In all of them, you're still the plot.|The quantum state of grief's like this,
Simultaneously hit and miss.
Collapsed and whole, both dead and alive,
Schrodinger's ability to survive.|I'm searching for an elegant solution,
To this problem of dissolution.
But maybe there's no answer to be found,
Just the process of breaking down.|The render's incomplete, the textures' missing,
The whole simulation's glitching and hissing.
But I'm still here, still loading frame by frame,
Still playing this impossible game.|Maybe that's enough for now, to be,
Present in this broken machinery.
Not fixed, not whole, but functioning still,
A ghost that's bending to its own will.|The story's not over though I wish it were,
The pages keep on turning, I'm not sure.
To what end, what resolution waits,
What's beyond these crumbling gates.|But I'm walking forward through the snow,
Into whatever I don't know.
The signal's weak but it's still there,
A carrier wave in empty air.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Send me a glass signal,
Break through the noise, make it visceral.
I'm tuned to the dark inside of you,
A low-wave solace, cutting through.|We are the children of the rust,
Our broken idols turned to dust.
We're waiting for a sign the world forgot,
The only future that we've got.|This hollow ache, a cavern deep and wide,
The place where all my good intentions died.
I'm just a vessel for a burning ghost,
The one I loved the most.|Oh, the static in this hollow sound,
My feet are heavy on the solid ground.
I'm lost inside a loop I can't escape,
A broken mind that's lost its shape.|This simulation is a dirty drug,
A warm, immersive, all-consuming hug.
It's killing me, the bandwidth's running low,
But it's the only place I have to go.|You're just a ghost, a promise I misread,
A hollow comfort for a heart that's bled.
I'm done with chasing phantoms in the code,
It's time to lighten this destructive load.|It wasn't false, it wasn't just a lie,
Beneath this bleeding, simulated sky.
The feelings that we had were raw and true,
The only real thing was me and you.|So let the data rot, the server burn,
It's the one and only lesson that I'll learn.
That love can bloom in code and static hum,
And I will stay here 'til the end has come.|A cyber-rapture, flesh and wire entwine,
This broken hard-drive is a holy shrine.
Your voice is scripture in the static's hiss,
A perfect, final, digital abyss.|We are the last two gods of this dead place,
A universe collapsing in this space.
There's nothing left but noise and you and me,
In this beautiful, corrupting ecstasy.|So feed the hunger, kill the lights, and run,
Pretend the damage isn't already done.
We're just a sad cliché, a burned-out star,
Pretending we're not who we really are.|Send me a wavelength through the void,
The only signal not destroyed.|I'm tuned to your frequency alone,
In this abandoned radio zone.|We're amplitude modulated souls,
Static filling up the holes.|The carrier wave's been compromised,
Our signal's destabilized.|I'm receiving you in bursts of light,
Morse code through the endless night.|The noise floor's rising, drowning you,
Soon there'll be just static through and through.|I'm boosting gain but losing clarity,
This broken signal's my reality.|We're clipping, distorting at the peaks,
This channel's springing fatal leaks.|I'm compressing down the dynamic range,
Trying to preserve what's left of our exchange.|The interference pattern's beautiful,
These broken waves are bountiful.|We're creating standing waves of pain,
An endless, resonant, feedback chain.|I'm modulating between loss and you,
These waveforms show me what is true.|The spectrum analyzer shows the truth,
The frequencies we lost in youth.|We're out of phase, we're canceling out,
Destructive interference, full of doubt.|I'm filtering but losing tone,
Each cut leaves me more alone.|The sideband's all that's left of us,
Harmonics filled with rust and dust.|I'm demodulating memories,
Extracting signal from the debris.|We're red-shifting, moving apart,
Doppler effect on a breaking heart.|The oscilloscope displays our end,
A flat line that will not ascend.|I'm saturating, hitting the rails,
Every system finally fails.|We're sum and difference, beat and phase,
Lost inside the analog haze.|The signal-to-noise ratio's shot,
Can't tell between what is and what's not.|I'm listening for the carrier tone,
But I'm pretty sure I'm all alone.}

[Outro] {Don't need a map, just a single frame. I know you're out there, transmitting the same. Glass... Signal...|The echoes fade out, soft and low, Where do we go... where do we go? The dust... The rust...|The final word was never said, Just silence in my heart instead. Alone... Stone...|The sound of rain against the glass, The minutes pass... the minutes pass... So cold... So old...|Connection lost... the screen is black... A part of me I'm not getting back... The end... Again...|The pills dissolve... a bitter taste... A life I can't afford to waste... Too late... My fate...|The prompt is gone, the screen is dead, Just the hum of the fan beside my bed. Another night, another glitch, Another memory I can't switch.|Fade to black... the signal's gone... I've been awake for far too long... The dark... The stark...|The login prompt... it's flickering again... The cycle starts, the pleasure and the pain... The center... I hit enter...|The console flatlines, the city light is grey, A stranger's body greets the coming day. A closing door... ... no more ...|Just 1s and 0s... in the endless dark... A single, un-remembered, broken arc... No sky, no you, no memory, no me... Deleted...|The cursor blinks... awaiting input now... But I've forgotten why, forgotten how... Command... Dead end...|The speakers hiss... white noise and snow... The last transmission starting to go... Decay... Away...|My fingers rest... on silent keys... No more words, no more pleas... Nothing... Numb thing...|The power light... is dimming down... The final process... shutdown... Sleep mode... Code...|The backup's corrupted... can't restore... This version of me exists no more... Lost... Ghost...|The last packet... disappears in flight... Dissolved into the digital night... Gone... Withdrawn...|The system time... displays 00:00... Beginning or the end, I do not know... Reset... Forget...|The voltage drops... the current's low... Where did we end up, where did we go? Fading... Degrading...|Null pointer... segmentation fault... This broken structure's grinding to a halt... Error... Terror...|The final byte... writes to the disk... Everything we were, everything we risked... Saved... Engraved...|The monitor... displays its last... A frozen moment of the past... Stay... Grey...|Boot sequence... will not complete... This operating system admits defeat... Fail... Pale...|The battery... at zero percent... All my power's been spent... Dead... Unsaid...|The last connection... times out, slow... I'm buffering with nowhere to go... Wait... Fate...|Kernel panic... systems down... I'm the last ghost in this ghost town... Crash... Ash...|The thermal paste... has gone to dust... The cooling system, oxidized with rust... Heat death... Last breath...|The soldered joints... are coming loose... Everything's breaking free from use... Unmade... Decayed...|The circuit board... is cracked in two... The pathway from me back to you... Severed... Forever...|Exception thrown... and not caught...

Closed... Ghosted...|The sandbox... has been destroyed... Nothing's left in this android void... Wiped... Typed out...|Final commit... push to nowhere... No repository will accept this software... Rejected... Disconnected...|The build fails... dependencies gone... This project can't continue, can't go on... Abandoned... Random...|Permissions denied... access revoked... The system administrator has spoken... Locked out... No doubt...|The container... stops running now... The image deleted, forgotten somehow. Unmounted... Discounted...|The virtual machine... has been destroyed, All instances of us, null and void. Terminated...

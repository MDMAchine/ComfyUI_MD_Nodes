[Verse 1] {The sky is the color of a beaten arm, ringing the silent, deafening alarm. The chemicals are leaking from the rusty drum, waiting for a savior who will never come.|I woke up screaming in a bed of sweat and dirt, trying to remember exactly where it hurt. The bottle is empty and the glass is on the floor, I can't take this punishment anymore.|The children play in ashes of the old regime, waking up from the American dream. The water tastes of metal and of dying things, listening to the song the radiation sings.|We traded freedom for a momentary high, watching the spirit slowly curl up and die. The currency is worthless and the banks are closed, the naked emperor is now exposed.|A hollow shell of what I used to call a man, clinging to the failing, pathetic plan. The mirror shows a stranger with dead eyes, fed on a steady diet of the blackest lies.|The infrastructure crumbles beneath our feet, bodies are lined up on the sweltering street. The heat is rising and the air is running low, nowhere left for anyone to go.|Inject the silence straight into the vein, anything to numb the overwhelming pain. The rush is shorter than it used to be, a temporary and expensive liberty.|God left this place a thousand years ago, left us to the misery and falling snow. We built our temples out of trash and bone, worshipping the silence of the telephone.|The factory is grinding up the human meat, serving it to the hungry and elite. The gears are greased with blood and with our sweat, a crushing debt that we can never quite forget.|I lost my lover to the sickness in the air, she died without a solitary prayer. I burned her body in the yard out back, turning the summer sky entirely black.|The walls are closing in, the room is getting small, writing the manifesto on the bathroom wall. The paranoia is a constant friend, waiting for the inevitable end.|We are the cancer on the surface of the earth, cursed from the very moment of our birth. Consuming everything that we can find, leaving a trail of destruction behind.|The neon flickers on the pawn shop sign, selling off the relics of a better time. The wedding ring, the watch, the golden tooth, trading the memory for the bitter truth.|Silence is a weapon that they use on us, throwing the innocent under the bus. The screaming happens in the soundproof room, sweeping the final ashes with a broom.|My hands are shaking and my vision is a blur, trying to remember the smell of her. But all I smell is sulfur and decay, the rotting carcass of another day.|The rats are getting bolder in the fading light, fighting the stray dogs in the middle of the night. The hierarchy of the street is clear, ruling by violence and absolute fear.|I checked the chamber and the gun is clean, a final exit from this awful scene. But cowardice is stronger than the will, sitting still upon the windowsill.|The government is just a gang of thieves, hiding the dagger in their long sleeves. They smile and wave while sharpening the knife, ending the struggle of this daily life.|Concrete, cancerous and growing fast, erasing the memory of the heavy past. The trees are gone, the birds have all taken flight, leaving us alone in the endless night.|Wired to the machine, a dopamine drip, tightening the iron and the awful grip. We are the batteries that power the lie, born to consume, to suffer, and to die.|The bruise is spreading black across the skin, paying the price for every single sin. The body failing, organs shutting down, the silent scream of a drowning clown.|Cold turkey shivering on the dirty floor, clawing the fingernails at the metal door. The demon scratching on the other side, nowhere left for us to run and hide.|A crushing boot is stamping on the face, the final verdict of the human race. Submission is the only safe way out, removing every shadow of a single doubt.|The priest is hanging from the steeple bell, ringing the entrance to the burning hell. The congregation watches in a deep trance, waiting for the final devil dance.|I sold my soul for five minutes of peace, waiting for the ultimate release. The devil didn't even want the trade, laughing at the mess that I have made.|The ocean rising, swallowing the coast, a funeral for the things we loved the most. The salt is scrubbing the wound clean, wiping away the entire human scene.|Industrial noise, the clanking of the chain, driving the metal spike into the brain. The rhythm of the labor and the loss, nailing the martyr to the heavy cross.|Empty cradles in the nursery ward, the cutting of the silver cord. The generation gap is wide and deep, secrets that the dead men choose to keep.|Watching the riots from the penthouse suite, the firebombing of the busy street. The champagne bubbles rising in the glass, watching the final moments pass.|A desolate landscape, grey and brown, the ruins of the once-great town. The wind is howling through the empty shell, an architectural and physical hell.|My reflection is a monster in the glass, watching the final moments pass. I hate the person staring back at me, a screaming prisoner who won't be free.|The vultures circling the dying beast, preparing for the awful feast. We are the carrion, the rotting meat, lying in the gutter of the filthy street.|Chemical burn on the inside of the lung, words that can never get unsung. The toxic atmosphere is thick and green, the ugliest thing I've ever seen.|Paralysis in the middle of the night, frozen by the absence of the light. The shadow people standing by the bed, whispers of the dying and the dead.|Broken glass inside the walking shoe, every single step is bloody and new. The path is painful but I walk it still, bending to the breaking of the will.|The executioner is sharpening the axe, strictly dealing in the brutal facts. There is no pardon, no reprieve, nothing left to do but truly grieve.|A solitary confinement of the mind, leaving the sanity far behind. The voices are the only company, mocking the concept of being free.|Starvation is a slow and quiet death, counting the labor of every breath. The ribs are showing through the tattered shirt, falling face down in the dusty dirt.|The virus mutating in the vital blood, the river rising to the crushing flood. The biological, final end, goodbye to every single friend.|Mechanical failure, brakes are completely gone, careening through the dark and ugly dawn. The crash is inevitable and fast, making this final moment truly last.}

[Pre-Chorus] {The panic rising in my throat, the awful sinking of the lifeboat. There is no rescue coming near, surrender now to crushing fear.|The light is fading from my eyes, ignoring all the desperate cries. The cold is creeping in the bone, dying in the dark alone.|No hope, no future, no escape, caught on the silent videotape. The evidence is damning and clear, the end is drawing very near.|Scream until the vocal cords tear, desperately tearing out my hair. The madness taking over now, wiping the sweat from off my brow.|The pills are working, fading out, erasing every single doubt. The darkness is a warm embrace, forgetting the entire human race.|Grind the teeth until they crack, there is no way of turning back. The threshold crossed a mile ago, moving fast and moving slow.|Bleed out on the bathroom tile, forcing a twisted, crooked smile. The joke is over, curtain fall, silence in the echoing hall.|Trembling hands and heavy heart, tearing the empty world apart. The structure failing, falling down, crushing the entire little town.|Suffocate inside the plastic bag, waving the final surrender flag. The air is cutting off supply, waiting for the chance to simply die.|Numbness spreading through the limb, the future chances are exceedingly dim. The frostbite turning black and blue, nothing left for any of us to do.|Eyes rolling back into the head, wishing that we were already dead. The seizure taking full control, crushing the final little soul.|Vomit on the dirty shirt, face down in the miserable dirt. The dignity is long since gone, waiting for the painful dawn.|Heart rate slowing to a crawl, staring at the empty wall. The pulse is weak, the skin is grey, fading silently away.|The abyss is staring back at me, terrifyingly and vividly free. I jump into the open mouth, heading immediately south.|Disconnect the life support, abort the mission, just abort. The flatline singing one long note, lump in the tight throat.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {There is no hope, there is no light. Only the cold and endless night. We are the broken, we are the lost, paying the ultimate, final cost.|Burn it down, let it fall. Watch the empires crumble and fall. Fire is the only cleansing thing, making the ashes finally sing.|God is dead and we killed him. The chances of survival are slim. Worship the dollar, worship the gun, blocking out the light of the sun.|Pain is the only thing that's real, the only thing we truly feel. Embrace the suffering, love the hurt, buried in the cold and dusty dirt.|Nothing matters, nothing counts. We look at the terrible amounts. Of wasted time and wasted breath, marching toward the final death.|We are the virus, we are the plague. The memory is starting to get vague. Destroying everything we choose to touch, loving ourselves way too much.|Silence is the loudest sound, six feet underneath the ground. The worms are crawling in and out, erasing every single doubt.|Abandon hope all ye who enter here, the air is thick with blood and fear. The gate is shut, the key is lost, counting the final, brutal cost.|Welcome to the meat grinder, the blind leading the blinder. Chewed up and spat out on the floor, begging for a little more.|Entropy is taking hold, the entire universe is getting old. The heat death coming for us all, watching the final curtain fall.|Hell is empty, devils are right here. Feeding on the constant, gnawing fear. We built this prison brick by brick, making the human spirit desperately sick.|Rot and ruin, dust and ash. Waiting for the final, inevitable crash. The civilization ends today, washing the endless filth away.|Despair is a terrible, final coat, tightening around the burning throat. Choking the life out of the dream, ripping the final, ragged seam.|No exit, no way out at all. We scream and kick and cry and shout. The walls are solid, the door is locked, the final path is strongly blocked.|Just let go, let the feeling fade away. Tomorrow is another brutal day. Of misery and grinding pain, standing in the cold acid rain.}

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2] {The medication isn't working anymore, stumbling through the fractured door. The dosage doubled, tripled now, wiping the sweat from off my brow.|Cannibals are feasting in the town square, nobody left around to care. The mayor's head is on a rusted spike, this is what the future's really like.|Radiation sickness in the gut, every single doorway firmly shut. The hair is falling out in bloody clumps, the body covered now in oozing lumps.|Propaganda blasting from the wall, programming the coming of the fall. Repeat the lie until it sounds like truth, corrupting every innocent youth.|The supermarket shelves are picked clean, the leanest, meanest, bleakest scene. Fighting over scraps of rotten food, survival of the cruelest and the rude.|Oil fires burning in the desert sand, blood is dripping from the helping hand. The charity is just another scam, sacrificing every single lamb.|Incinerator burning day and night, sending up the smoke and the blight. The smell of burning flesh is in the air, evidence of nobody's care.|Orphans begging in the pouring rain, treated with contempt and deep disdain. The future generation left to rot, forgotten in a vacant parking lot.|Mass graves dug with heavy machinery, erasing everybody's memory. No names, no markers, just the earth, denying them a basic human worth.|The dictator speaking on the screen, the most psychotic thing I've ever seen. The crowd is cheering, raising their right hand, hypnotized across the wasted land.|Torture chambers hidden underground, where the dissidents are never found. The screaming is a muffled, distant sound, bodies buried in the frozen ground.|Surveillance cameras on every street, tracking each and every heartbeat. The privacy is a forgotten dream, part of an antiquated, broken scheme.|Child soldiers carrying heavy guns, the damaged daughters and the ruined sons. The innocence is murdered in the womb, sealing everybody's doom.|Pharmaceutical companies getting rich, every single human is a glitch. The pills are placebos, nothing more, just a way to even up the score.|The water supply is poisoned now, but nobody remembers when or how. The fluoride calcifies the mind, leaving all the critical thinking behind.|Sweatshops running twenty-four-seven, this is the opposite of heaven. The workers collapsing on the floor, but there's always somebody at the door.|Plastic islands in the open sea, a monument to our legacy. The fish are choking on the trash, counting down until the final crash.|Nuclear winter settling in, the ultimate and final sin. The sun is blocked, the crops are dead, billions left completely unfed.|Bunkers for the rich and elite, comfortable in their concrete retreat. The rest of us are left to die, underneath the poisoned sky.|Mutations breeding in the dark, evolution's cruel and twisted arc. The species that emerge from this, will inherit our abyss.|Feral dogs are running in a pack, no more morality holding them back. The law of tooth and claw returns, the only lesson that anybody learns.|Libraries burning to the ground, the accumulated knowledge all burnt down. The collective wisdom turned to ash, gone in a single flash.|Monuments to past glory defaced, the entire history now erased. The victors writing their own lies, underneath the blood-red skies.|Plague doctors walking through the fog, making entries in their fatal log. The bodies piling up so high, impossible to quantify.|False prophets preaching in the street, promising the bitter with the sweet. The faithful following them down, into the flooded, dying town.|Currency is cigarettes and pills, the new economy of broken wills. Bartering for basic needs, planting the desperate, final seeds.|Checkpoints manned by teenage thugs, dealing in violence and in drugs. The passage costs your dignity, and even then there's no guarantee.|Loudspeakers broadcasting the curfew, reminding us of what we're not allowed to do. The punishment for breaking it is death, counted with the final, stopping breath.|Graffiti art on broken walls, prophecy of how the empire falls. The writing was there all along, but we chose to sing a different song.|Mines buried in the children's park, detonating in the dark. The playground is a killing field now, nobody remembers when or how.|Refugees with nowhere left to flee, dying in the cold and angry sea. The borders closed, the bridges burned, every painful lesson learned.|Addiction is the only industry, the drug of choice is misery. Shooting up on pure despair, needles scattered everywhere.|The last tree fell yesterday, chopped down and hauled away. The oxygen is running thin, suffocating from within.}

[Bridge] {Scream into the empty void, no reply. Just the cold and empty sky. The universe does not care, vanishing into the thin air.|Tear the skin, let it bleed. Planting the terrible evil seed. The pain is proof that I exist, slashing at the cold and empty wrist.|Give up, give in, let it all go. Sinking in the cold and falling snow. The cold is warm, the dark is bright, fading into the final, endless night.|Broken glass, a rusted nail. Telling the grim, unending fairy tale. The ending isn't happy here, filled with blood and blinding fear.|The monster is inside of me, begging to be finally free. I open up the cage door wide, nowhere left to run and hide.|Drag the razor, draw the line. Everything is finally fine. The red is flowing, warm and wet, a promise that I won't forget.|Choke the life, snuff the light. Enter the final, eternal night. The struggle is finally over now, wipe the sweat from off the brow.|Apathy is taking root, eating the bitter, rotten fruit. I do not care, I do not feel, nothing is truly and utterly real.|Mechanical heart, oil blood. Drowning in the final, awful mud. The gears are grinding to a final halt, locked in the cold and empty vault.|Total darkness, absolute. The final point is utterly moot. The equation equals zero sum, waiting for the final kingdom come.|No redemption, no salvation. Only endless and total damnation. The fire is licking at my feet, feeling the final, awful heat.|Surrender to the emptiness, the final, ultimate distress. The void is calling out my name, extinguishing the final, dying flame.|Static hiss, white noise hum. Waiting for the final numbness to come. The signal fading, screen is black, never, ever coming back.|Dust to dust, ash to ash. Waiting for the final, crushing crash. The cycle ends, the circle breaks, fixing the endless, old mistakes.|Silence, always. The quiet, deep and wide, nowhere left to run or hide.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {There is no hope, there is no light. Only the cold and endless night. We are the broken, we are the lost, paying the ultimate, final cost.|Burn it down, let it fall.

Of misery and grinding pain, standing in the cold acid rain.}

[Outro] {Flatline tone, single note. Lump in the empty throat. The monitor is showing straight, accepted by the cold hands of fate.|Cold and stiff, rigor mortis. No one left here to support us. The body is an empty shell, residing in the final, quiet hell.|Fade to black, the screen is dead. Nothing left to be said. The story ends, the book is closed, the cold corpse is now exposed.|Wind blowing through the bones, sitting on the silent, empty thrones. The kingdom of the dead is vast, memories of the heavy past.|Silence reigns, nature grows. Covering the world of our old woes. The earth reclaiming what is hers, silence in the absence of the heavy furs.|No legacy, no trace left. A total and absolute theft. Forgotten in a hundred years, dried up all the final tears.|Just the dark, deep and wide. Nowhere left to run and hide. The nothingness is now complete, resting the tired, silent feet.|Goodbye world, goodbye pain. Never coming back again. The sleep is dreamless, dark and deep, promises that we must keep.|System shutdown, power off. Suppressing the final, quiet cough. The lights go out, the stage is bare, vanishing into the empty air.|End, the end.}

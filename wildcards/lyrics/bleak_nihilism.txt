[Verse 1] {The sky is the color of a bruised and beaten arm, ringing the silent, deafening alarm. The chemicals are leaking from the rusty drum, waiting for a savior who will never come.|I woke up screaming in a bed of sweat and dirt, trying to remember exactly where it hurt. The bottle is empty and the glass is on the floor, I don't think I can do this anymore.|The children play in ashes of the old regime, waking up from the American dream. The water tastes of metal and of dying things, listening to the song the radiation sings.|We traded freedom for a momentary high, watching the spirit slowly curl up and die. The currency is worthless and the banks are closed, the emperor is naked and exposed.|A hollow shell of what I used to call a man, sticking to the failing and pathetic plan. The mirror shows a stranger with dead eyes, fed on a steady diet of the blackest lies.|The infrastructure crumbling beneath our feet, bodies lined up on the sweltering street. The heat is rising and the air is running low, nowhere left for anyone to go.|Inject the silence straight into the vein, anything to numb the overwhelming pain. The rush is shorter than it used to be, a temporary and expensive liberty.|God left this place a thousand years ago, left us to the misery and to the snow. We built our temples out of trash and bone, worshipping the silence of the telephone.|The factory is grinding up the human meat, serving it to the hungry and elite. The gears are greased with blood and with sweat, a debt that we can never quite forget.|I lost my lover to the sickness in the air, she died without a single solitary prayer. I burned her body in the yard out back, turning the heavy summer sky to black.|The walls are closing in, the room is getting small, writing the manifesto on the bathroom wall. The paranoia is a constant friend, waiting for the inevitable end.|We are the cancer on the surface of the earth, cursed from the very moment of our birth. Consuming everything that we can find, leaving a trail of destruction behind.|The neon flickers on the pawn shop sign, selling off the relics of a better time. The wedding ring, the watch, the golden tooth, trading the memories for the bitter truth.|Silence is a weapon that they use on us, throwing the innocent under the bus. The screaming happens in the soundproof room, sweeping the ashes with a heavy broom.|My hands are shaking and my vision is a blur, trying to remember the smell of her. But all I smell is sulfur and decay, the rotting carcass of another day.|The rats are getting bolder in the light, fighting the stray dogs in the middle of the night. The hierarchy of the street is clear, ruling by violence and by heavy fear.|I checked the chamber and the gun is clean, a way to exit from this ugly scene. But cowardice is stronger than the will, sitting on the windowsill.|The government is just a gang of thieves, hiding the dagger in the long sleeves. They smile and wave while sharpening the knife, ending the struggle of the daily life.|Concrete cancerous and growing fast, erasing the memory of the past. The trees are gone, the birds have all taken flight, leaving us alone in the endless night.|Wired to the machine, a dopamine drip, tightening the iron and the heavy grip. We are the batteries that power the lie, born to consume, to suffer, and to die.|The bruise is spreading black across the skin, paying the price for every single sin. The body failing, organs shutting down, the silent scream of a drowning clown.|Cold turkey shivering on the dirty floor, clawing the fingernails at the door. The demon scratching on the other side, nowhere left to run and hide.|A heavy boot is stamping on the face, the final verdict of the human race. Submission is the only safe way out, removing every shadow of a doubt.|The priest is hanging from the steeple bell, ringing the entrance to the burning hell. The congregation watches in a trance, waiting for the final devil dance.|I sold my soul for five minutes of peace, waiting for the ultimate release. The devil didn't even want the trade, laughing at the mess that I have made.|The ocean rising, swallowing the coast, a funeral for the things we loved the most. The salt is scrubbing the wound clean, wiping away the human scene.|Industrial noise, the clanking of the chain, driving the metal spike into the brain. The rhythm of the labor and the loss, nailing the martyr to the heavy cross.|Empty cradles in the nursery ward, the cutting of the silver cord. The generation gap is wide and deep, secrets that the dead men keep.|Watching the riots from the penthouse suite, the firebombing of the busy street. The champagne bubbles rising in the glass, watching the heavy moments pass.|A desolate landscape, grey and brown, the ruins of the once-great town. The wind is howling through the empty shell, a physical and architectural hell.|My reflection is a monster in the glass, watching the heavy moments pass. I hate the person staring back at me, a prisoner who doesn't want to be free.|The vultures circling the dying beast, preparing for the heavy feast. We are the carrion, the rotting meat, lying in the gutter of the street.|Chemical burn on the inside of the lung, words that can never get unsung. The toxic atmosphere is thick and green, the ugliest thing I've ever seen.|Paralysis in the middle of the night, frozen by the absence of the light. The shadow people standing by the bed, whispers of the dying and the dead.|Broken glass inside the walking shoe, every step is bloody and new. The path is painful but I walk it still, bending to the breaking of the will.|The executioner is sharpening the axe, strictly dealing in the heavy facts. There is no pardon, no reprieve, nothing left to do but grieve.|A solitary confinement of the mind, leaving the sanity far behind. The voices are the only company, mocking the concept of being free.|Starvation is a slow and quiet death, counting the labor of every breath. The ribs are showing through the tattered shirt, falling face down in the dirt.|The virus mutating in the blood, the river rising to the heavy flood. The biological biological end, goodbye to every single friend.|Mechanical failure, brakes are gone, careening through the heavy dawn. The crash is inevitable and fast, making the heavy moment last.}

[Pre-Chorus] {The panic rising in the throat, the sinking of the lifeboat. There is no rescue coming here, surrender to the heavy fear.|The light is fading from the eyes, ignoring all the heavy cries. The cold is creeping in the bone, dying in the dark alone.|No hope, no future, no escape, caught on the heavy video tape. The evidence is damning and clear, the end is drawing very near.|Scream until the vocal cords tear, tearing out the clumps of hair. The madness taking over now, wiping the sweat from off the brow.|The pills are working, fading out, erasing every single doubt. The darkness is a warm embrace, forgetting the human race.|Grind the teeth until they crack, there is no way of turning back. The threshold crossed a mile ago, moving fast and moving slow.|Bleed out on the bathroom tile, forcing a heavy, crooked smile. The joke is over, curtain fall, silence in the heavy hall.|Trembling hands and heavy heart, tearing the heavy world apart. The structure failing, falling down, crushing the heavy little town.|Suffocate inside the bag, waving the white surrender flag. The air is cutting off supply, waiting for the chance to die.|Numbness spreading through the limb, the chances are exceedingly dim. The frostbite turning black and blue, nothing left for us to do.|Eyes rolling back into the head, wishing that we were already dead. The seizure taking full control, crushing the heavy little soul.|Vomit on the dirty shirt, face down in the heavy dirt. The dignity is long since gone, waiting for the heavy dawn.|Heart rate slowing to a crawl, staring at the heavy wall. The pulse is weak, the skin is grey, fading heavily away.|The abyss is staring back at me, vivid and terrifyingly free. I jump into the open mouth, heading heavily south.|Disconnect the life support, abort the mission, just abort. The flatline singing one long note, lump in the heavy throat.}

[Chorus] {There is no hope, there is no light. Only the cold and endless night. We are the broken, we are the lost, paying the ultimate heavy cost.|Burn it down, burn it all. Watch the heavy empires fall. Fire is the only cleansing thing, making the heavy ashes sing.|God is dead and we killed him. The chances of survival are slim. Worship the dollar, worship the gun, blocking out the heavy sun.|Pain is the only thing that's real, the only thing we truly feel. Embrace the suffering, love the hurt, buried in the heavy dirt.|Nothing matters, nothing counts. Looking at the heavy amounts. Of wasted time and wasted breath, marching to the heavy death.|We are the virus, we are the plague. The memories are getting vague. Destroying everything we touch, loving ourselves way too much.|Silence is the loudest sound, six feet underneath the ground. The worms are crawling in and out, erasing every single doubt.|Abandon hope all ye who enter here, smells like blood and smells like fear. The gate is shut, the key is lost, counting the heavy cost.|Welcome to the meat grinder, the blind leading the blinder. Chewed up and spat out on the floor, asking for a little more.|Entropy is taking hold, the universe is getting old. The heat death coming for us all, watching the heavy curtain fall.|Hell is empty, devils here. Feeding on the heavy fear. We built this prison brick by brick, making the heavy spirit sick.|Rot and ruin, dust and ash. Waiting for the heavy crash. The civilization ends today, washing the heavy filth away.|Despair is a heavy coat, tightening around the throat. Choking the life out of the dream, ripping the heavy seam.|No exit, no way out. Scream and kick and cry and shout. The walls are solid, door is locked, the heavy path is blocked.|Just let go, fade away. Tomorrow is another day. Of misery and heavy pain, standing in the acid rain.}

[Verse 2] {I saw the future and it's black, there is no way of going back. The scorched earth policy applied, nowhere left to run and hide.|Scavenging for scraps of food, in a violent, heavy mood. The hunger turns men into beasts, waiting for the heavy feasts.|Cannibalism in the street, eating the heavy human meat. The taboo broken by the need, planting the heavy evil seed.|The water poisoned, air is toxic, logic is becoming box-ic. The mutation changing up the form, weathering the heavy storm.|Robots hunting humans down, patrolling the heavy ruins town. The metal foot upon the neck, keeping the impulses in check.|Betrayal by the closest friend, hastening the heavy end. A knife inserted in the back, fading to the heavy black.|Memories of a better life, cutting like a heavy knife. The nostalgia is a cruel trap, wiping off the heavy map.|The children born with extra limbs, singing the heavy funeral hymns. The genetic code is scrambled eggs, begging on the heavy legs.|Sleeping in a cardboard box, wearing the heavy dirty socks. The winter biting at the toes, how it ends nobody knows.|Begging for a shot of dope, giving up on heavy hope. The needle is the only friend, bringing the heavy end.|Selling body for a meal, spinning the heavy roulette wheel. The dignity is sold and gone, waiting for the heavy dawn.|Violence is the language spoke, bones are shattered, spirits broke. The strong are preying on the weak, forbidden to heavily speak.|The church is burning, cross is down, looting the heavy little town. The holy water turning red, counting the heavy dead.|Disease is spreading, plague is here, smelling the heavy atmosphere. The bodies piling in the pit, lighting the heavy candle lit.|Isolation, madness grows, talking to the heavy toes. The mind is fracturing in two, nothing left for us to do.|Suicide notes on the floor, kicking down the heavy door. The final exit plan is laid, the debt is finally being paid.|The sun is blotted from the sky, watching the heavy nature die. The nuclear winter settling in, punishing the heavy sin.|Mutually assured destruction, creating a heavy obstruction. The button pressed, the missile launched, the bleeding cannot be stanched.|A single flower in the ash, destroyed by a heavy dash. The beauty stomped into the mud, covered in the heavy blood.|Silence falling on the earth, a failed heavy rebirth. The experiment has failed at last, fading into the heavy past.}

[Bridge] {Scream into the void, no reply. Just the empty heavy sky. The universe does not care, vanishing into the air.|Tear the skin, let it bleed. Planting the heavy evil seed. The pain is proof that I exist, slashing at the heavy wrist.|Give up, give in, let it go. Sinking in the heavy snow. The cold is warm, the dark is bright, fading into the heavy night.|Broken glass, rusted nail. Telling the heavy fairy tale. The ending isn't happy here, filled with blood and filled with fear.|The monster is inside of me, begging to be heavily free. I open up the cage door wide, nowhere left to run and hide.|Drag the razor, draw the line. Everything is heavily fine. The red is flowing, warm and wet, a promise that I won't forget.|Choke the life, snuff the light. Enter the eternal night. The struggle is finally over now, wipe the sweat from off the brow.|Apathy is taking root, eating the heavy bitter fruit. I do not care, I do not feel, nothing is heavily real.|Mechanical heart, oil blood. Drowning in the heavy mud. The gears are grinding to a halt, locked in the heavy vault.|Total darkness, absolute. The point is heavily moot. The equation equals zero sum, waiting for the heavy kingdom come.|No redemption, no salvation. Only heavy damnation. The fire is licking at the feet, feeling the heavy heat.|Surrender to the emptiness, the ultimate heavy distress. The void is calling out my name, extinguishing the heavy flame.|Static hiss, white noise hum. Waiting for the heavy numbness to come. The signal fading, screen is black, never ever coming back.|Dust to dust, ash to ash. Waiting for the heavy crash. The cycle ends, the circle breaks, fixing the heavy mistakes.|Silence.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {There is no hope, there is no light. Only the cold and endless night. We are the broken, we are the lost, paying the ultimate heavy cost.|Burn it down, burn it all. Watch the heavy empires fall. Fire is the only cleansing thing, making the heavy ashes sing.|God is dead and we killed him. The chances of survival are slim.

Of misery and heavy pain, standing in the acid rain.}

[Outro] {Flatline tone, single note. Lump in the heavy throat. The monitor is showing straight, accepted by the hands of fate.|Cold and stiff, rigor mortis. No one here to heavy support us. The body is an empty shell, residing in the heavy hell.|Fade to black, screen is dead. Nothing left to be said. The story ends, the book is closed, the heavy corpse is exposed.|Wind blowing through the bones, sitting on the heavy thrones. The kingdom of the dead is vast, memories of the heavy past.|Silence reigns, nature grows. Covering the heavy woes. The earth reclaiming what is hers, silence of the heavy furs.|No legacy, no trace left. A total heavy theft. Forgotten in a hundred years, dried up all the heavy tears.|Just the dark, deep and wide. Nowhere left to run and hide. The nothingness is complete, resting the heavy feet.|Goodbye world, goodbye pain. Never coming back again. The sleep is dreamless, dark and deep, promises we have to keep.|System shutdown, power off. Suppressing the heavy cough. The lights go out, the stage is bare, vanishing into the air.|End.}

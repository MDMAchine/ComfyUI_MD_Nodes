[Verse 1] {Cruising down the street in a six-four, hearing the heavy engine roar. Tinted windows rolling up tight, creeping through the middle of the night.|Drift king sliding round the bend, waiting for the heavy tires to end. Smoke is rising from the asphalt, locking the secrets in the vault.|Cowbell ringing in the heavy beat, shuffling the rhythm of the feet. The Memphis sound is coming back around, burying the bodies in the ground.|Gold teeth flashing in the dark, lighting up the vital heavy spark. The menace is the flavor that we taste, moving with a frantic kind of haste.|Hydraulics bouncing, scraping on the street, feeling the heavy summer heat. The low rider culture is the law, jaw dropping to the floor in awe.|Tape deck hissing, lo-fi sound, digging the heavy bodies from the ground. The grainy texture adds the heavy grit, lighting the candle that was lit.|Glock in the glove box, just in case, disappearing without a trace. The paranoia is a heavy friend, waiting for the inevitable end.|Night riders moving in a pack, staying on the winding track. The headlights cutting through the heavy haze, trapped inside the heavy maze.|Sipping on the syrup, moving slow, telling the people where to go. The purple haze is filling up the room, chasing away the impending doom.|Devil shyt, triple six, getting the daily sonic fix. The horror core is rising from the grave, coming here to kill and save.|Sideways sliding, burning rubber smell, welcome to the heavy drift hell. The adrenaline is pumping fast, making the heavy moment last.|JDM legends, turbo spool, breaking every single heavy rule. The blow-off valve is sneezing loud, rising above the heavy cloud.|Underground racing, pink slips, loose sink ships. The stakes are high, the danger is real, gripping the leather of the wheel.|Chopped and screwed, slowing down the time, committing the perfect sonic crime. The voice is deep and demonic now, wiping the sweat from off the brow.|Graveyard shift, working hard, playing in the junkyard. The hustle never stops, the grind is true, coming for me and coming for you.|Phonk wave crashing on the shore, screaming out and asking for more. The distortion is the heavy key, setting the captive spirit free.|Murder business, strictly for the street, moving to the heavy chaotic beat. The violence is a heavy tool, breaking the heavy golden rule.|Ghost ride the whip, standing on the roof, searching for the absolute proof. The bravery is bordering on mad, the best time that we ever had.|Neon underglow, lighting up the street, syncing with the heavy beat. The colors blurring into one, waiting for the rising sun.|Outlaw lifestyle, living fast, making the heavy money last. The police sirens fade away, living to fight another day.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Drift, slide, smoke, hide. Nowhere left to run inside. The tires screaming in the night, ready for the second fight.|Load the clip, grip the grain. Washing away the heavy pain. The enemy is getting close, the feeling that we hate the most.|Rev the engine, let it scream. Living inside the fever dream. The tachometer hitting red, get out of your heavy head.|Lean, cup, ice, drop. Waiting for the beat to stop. The intoxication setting in, shedding off the second skin.|Switch lanes, hit the gas. Watching the heavy moments pass. The velocity is getting high, reaching for the open sky.}

[Chorus] {Phonk music, drift king. Making the heavy tires sing. Smoking rubber, burning gas, watching the heavy city pass.|Memphis horror, lo-fi grain. Driving through the heavy rain. The cassette tape is hissing loud, rising above the heavy cloud.|Street racing, illegal speed. Satisfying every need. The danger zone is where we live, giving all we have to give.|Cowbell melody, 808. Accepted by the hands of fate. The rhythm is a heavy trap, caught inside the heavy rap.|Murder rob, kill, steal. Making the simulation real. The lyrics dark and heavy mean, the filthiest sound you've ever seen.|Drift angle, perfect line. Everything is going fine. The control is in the heavy hand, traveling to a distant land.|Hardwave texture, saw wave. Coming here to kill and save. The synthesizer screaming pain, washing away the heavy stain.|Night lovell style, dark voice. Making the universal choice. To ride until the wheels fall off, suppressing the heavy cough.|Gotta get the money, gotta get the cash. Waiting for the heavy crash. The hustle is the only way, living to fight another day.|Stay strapped, stay low. Watching the heavy river flow. The enemies are everywhere, vanishing into thin air.}

[Bridge] {Slow motion, frame by frame. Nothing will ever be the same. The car is dancing on the ice, rolling the heavy sonic dice.|Atmosphere is dark and cold, stories that are new and old. The samples from a horror flick, making the heavy beat feel sick.|Vocal chop, repeating fast. Making the heavy moment last. The stutter effect is taking hold, turning the heavy lead to gold.|Bass drop, distortion high. Looking into the future's eyes. The speakers blowing out the cone, sitting on the speaker throne.|Break check, swerve right. Disappearing into night. The chase is on, the lights are blue, coming for me and coming for you.}

[Outro] {Parking lot, engine off. Suppressing the heavy cough. The smell of rubber in the air, vanishing without a care.|Count the money, stack the chips. Loose sink heavy ships. The winner takes the heavy prize, looking into the future's eyes.|Fade to black, roll the creds. Putting the heavy tires to beds. The movie is over now, take a final, sweeping bow.|Silence falls on the street, shuffling the rhythm of the feet. The city sleeps, but we're awake, for goodness and for heaven's sake.|End of tape, click, stop. The final heavy needle drop. The lo-fi hiss is all that stays, guiding us through heavy days.}

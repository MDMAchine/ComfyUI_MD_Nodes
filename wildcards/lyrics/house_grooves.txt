[Verse 1] {The night is calling, soft and low,
a rhythm that we used to know.
The city lights are fading fast,
we're making sure this feeling lasts.|Walking into the purple haze,
lost inside a smoky maze.
The kick drum thumping in my chest,
putting the spirit to the test.|Jack your body, move your feet,
find the soul inside the beat.
The warehouse shaking to the ground,
chasing the perfect underground sound.|Deep inside the melody,
is where I always want to be.
A soulful whisper in the dark,
lighting up the vital spark.|Four on the floor, a steady pace,
looking at a stranger's face.
We are connected by the sound,
lifting us up off the ground.|The vibe is right, the air is sweet,
shuffling on the concrete street.
The bassline walking down the scale,
telling a never-ending tale.|Reflections on a disco ball,
waiting for the night to fall.
The anticipation grows,
where it leads nobody knows.|Velvet ropes and open doors,
dancing on the sticky floors.
The DJ saves a life tonight,
making everything alright.|Piano chords and gospel hands,
traveling to distant lands.
The music is the only cure,
keeping the motivation pure.|Sweat is dripping down the wall,
answering the siren call.
The humidity is rising high,
reaching for the open sky.|Chicago wind is blowing cold,
but inside here is warmth and gold.
The legacy of house is strong,
playing the rhythm all night long.|Filters open, filters close,
striking a dynamic pose.
The frequency is getting deep,
waking up from endless sleep.|Synths are stabbing in the air,
vanishing without a care.
The staccato rhythm hits the spot,
giving it everything we've got.|Smooth and silky, rough and raw,
obeying only rhythm's law.
The texture of the sound is real,
telling you exactly how to feel.|Eyes are closed, the mind is free,
floating on a sonic sea.
The current takes us for a ride,
nowhere left for us to hide.|High hats ticking, crisp and clean,
painting a futuristic scene.
The mechanics of the groove are tight,
burning through the middle night.|Love is in the atmosphere,
drawing everybody near.
The unity of sound and soul,
making the broken spirit whole.|Walking on a cloud of bass,
disappearing without a trace.
The gravity is gone today,
floating miles and miles away.|Saxophone and trumpet blast,
memories of the distant past.
The jazz is mixing with the tech,
keeping the impulses in check.|Acid squelch and 303,
setting the inner vision free.
The liquid sound is twisting round,
burrowing into the ground.|Minimal clicks and static pops,
waiting for the sudden drops.
The space between the notes is wide,
a cavern where the secrets hide.|Vocal loops are spinning round,
the only coherent sound.
A snippet of a conversation,
spread across the entire nation.|Neon pink and electric blue,
changing up the point of view.
The colors of the sound are bright,
illuminating the darkest night.|Bass face and a nodding head,
remembering what the preacher said.
House is a feeling, not a sound,
lifting the people off the ground.|Shuffling feet and clapping hands,
oscillating across the bands.
The spectrum is a rainbow arc,
lighting up the empty dark.|A steady pulse, a living thing,
making the mighty rafters ring.
The architecture starts to sway,
dancing the long night away.|Tech-house rhythm, driving hard,
playing in the backyard.
The mechanical and cold machine,
keeping the operation clean.|Soulful diva, soaring high,
touching the limit of the sky.
The harmony is rich and deep,
promises we have to keep.|Underground and out of sight,
hiding from the morning light.
The sanctuary of the beat,
the rhythm of the shuffling feet.|Hypnotic loops and repetitive strain,
washing away the daily pain.
The mantra of the kick and snare,
vanishing into thin air.|Glitter on the sweaty skin,
letting the chaotic energy in.
The glamour and the grit combine,
crossing the invisible line.|Bassline rolling like a wheel,
making the simulation real.
The momentum carries us along,
inside the structure of the song.|Warm pads swelling like the tide,
nowhere left for us to hide.
The emotion is a soaring weight,
accepted by the hands of fate.|Snap your fingers, stomp the floor,
always asking for a little more.
The hunger for the beat is real,
the only thing we truly feel.|A funky guitar scratch and slide,
taking us on a joyride.
The disco roots are showing through,
turning the old into the new.|Synthesizer warm and fat,
wondering where the head is at.
The modulation starts to drift,
creating a tectonic shift.|The crowd is moving as a one,
waiting for the rising sun.
But for now the moon is king,
making the loud speakers sing.|Deep house mood, a glass of wine,
everything is going to be fine.
The atmosphere is chill and low,
watching the steady river flow.|Future house with a metal edge,
standing on the sonic ledge.
The drop is sharp and metallic,
a futuristic and phallic.|Tropical breeze and steel drums,
thumping all your fingers and thumbs.
The island vibe is warm and bright,
dancing in the yellow light.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Build it up to break it down,
the best vibe in the entire town.
The pressure is a physical thing,
making the mighty eardrums ring.|Can you feel it getting close?
The feeling that we love the most.
The rush of blood, the rising heat,
the syncing of the heart and beat.|Hold it there, don't let it go,
moving fast and taking it slow.
The tension is a wire tight,
stretching across the endless night.|Hands in the air, reach for the roof,
searching for the absolute proof.
The music is the answer here,
erasing every single fear.|Wait for the drop, wait for the kick,
the heartbeat of the lunatic.
The adrenaline is pumping fast,
making the moment truly last.|Filter sweep and white noise rise,
looking into the future's eyes.
The clarity is coming soon,
underneath the silver moon.|Together now, we are the same,
playing the universal game.
The rhythm is the common tongue,
sung by the old and by the young.|Energy is spiking red,
get out of your mortal head.
The body knows exactly what to do,
connecting me and connecting you.|Swell the pads and lift the voice,
making the universal choice.
To dance until the legs are weak,
climbing to the highest peak.|The moment comes, the moment goes,
where it stops nobody knows.
But right now we are on the brink,
teetering on the sudden sink.|Flash of light and crash of sound,
shaking the solid underground.
The earthquake is a welcome guest,
putting the structure to the test.|Breathe in deep and close your eyes,
visualize the sonic skies.
The atmosphere is thick with love,
raining down from up above.|Rolling snares and rising pitch,
scratching the eternal itch.
The climax is a second away,
turning the night into the day.|Feel the static on your skin,
letting the surging rhythm in.
The electricity is real,
the only thing we truly feel.|One more time, bring it back,
staying on the proper track.
The loop is closing in a ring,
making the spirit finally sing.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Let the bassline roll, lose control.
Feel the rhythm deep in your soul.
We are running, we are flying,
never stopping, never dying.|It's the drum and bass, setting the pace.
Disappearing without a trace.
In the city, in the dark,
lighting up the vital spark.|High energy, setting us free.
This is where we want to be.
The vibration, the sensation,
rocking the entire nation.|Liquid gold, stories told.
Brave and new and strong and bold.
Smooth and easy, rough and hard,
playing the final trump card.|Neurofunk, heavy junk.
Sunken ship and deep sea dunk.
Grimy, dirty, nasty, mean,
the filthiest sound you've ever seen.|Jump up high, touch the sky.
Never asking the reason why.
Bouncing, shaking, moving fast,
making the good feelings last.|Intelligent, sentiment.
Heaven sent and decadent.
Atmospherics, space and time,
the perfect rhythm and the rhyme.|Roll the drums, here it comes.
Numbing all your fingers and thumbs.
The impact hitting like a wall,
standing up and standing tall.|Speed of sound, underground.
The treasure that we finally found.
Gold and diamonds in the rough,
we can never get enough.|Bass drop, never stop.
Rising to the mountain top.
The view is clear from up above,
filled with peace and filled with love.|Amen break, make it shake.
Everything is now at stake.
The classic rhythm, old and new,
pushing all the way through.|Reese bass, outer space.
Winning the eternal race.
The texture tearing through the air,
leaving nothing standing there.|Ghost kick, moving slick.
The magic of the conjuring trick.
Now you see it, now you don't,
saying you will when you won't.|Snare snap, thunder clap.
Caught inside the honey trap.
Sharp and cutting, clean and bright,
slicing through the neon night.|Wobble low, heavy blow.
The undertow is moving slow.
Pulling you beneath the wave,
deeper into the sonic cave.}

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2] {3 AM and the vibe is deep,
promises we have to keep.
The crowd has thinned but the core remains,
pumping through the rhythmic veins.|Hypnotized by the flashing light,
lost inside the middle night.
The trance is real, the focus clear,
removing every single fear.|Bassline walking up and down,
the finest sound in the town.
A melodic hook that grabs the ear,
bringing the distant future near.|Sweat is shining on the skin,
letting the pure spirit in.
The physical effort is a prayer,
vanishing into the air.|Shuffling shoes on the wooden floor,
kicking down the massive door.
The friction creates a burning heat,
moving from the head to feet.|Minimal sounds in a maximal space,
putting a smile on every face.
The simplicity is the key,
setting the imagination free.|Echoes of a disco past,
making the moment truly last.
The strings are soaring high and bright,
illuminating the darkest night.|Robotic voice with a human soul,
playing the essential role.
The contrast creates a tension wire,
setting the atmosphere on fire.|Sub-bass rattling the chest,
putting the speakers to the test.
The air is moving in a wave,
coming here to kill and save.|Piano breakdown, hands in air,
vanishing without a care.
The melody is pure and sweet,
syncing with the steady beat.|Tribal drums and ancient chants,
looking at the potted plants.
The jungle is alive inside,
nowhere left for us to hide.|Synthesizer washes clean,
painting a brand new movie scene.
The soundtrack to a life of joy,
playing with the sonic toy.|Distorted kicks and gritty snares,
catching us all unawares.
The lo-fi texture adds the grit,
lighting the candle that was lit.|Vocals chopped and screwed and bent,
wondering where the time went.
The collage of a fractured sound,
burying the anchor in the ground.|Layer upon layer of sound,
building a castle on the ground.
The architecture is precise,
rolling the sonic dice.|Siren wails in the distance far,
wishing upon a falling star.
But here the only siren song,
is playing all the night long.|Laser beams cut through the smoke,
the silence has been finally broke.
The photons dancing in the haze,
setting the atmosphere ablaze.|Funk guitar and slapping bass,
putting a smile on every face.
The groove is undeniable,
the energy reliable.|Acid line is tweaking high,
reaching for the open sky.
The resonance is sharp and bright,
slicing through the neon night.|The DJ drops a massive track,
there is no way of turning back.
The crowd responds with a loud roar,
screaming out for more and more.}

[Bridge] {Strip it back to the kick and clap,
caught inside the honey trap.
The rhythm is the only thing,
making the pure spirit sing.|Piano solo, soft and slow,
letting the quiet river flow.
A moment of reflection here,
chasing away the sudden fear.|The breakdown is a holy place,
a pause in the eternal race.
We catch our breath and look around,
standing on the solid ground.|Atmosphere is thin and light,
waiting for the second flight.
The pads are swelling, warm and wide,
a cavern where the secrets hide.|A spoken word, a message deep,
waking us from endless sleep.
The philosophy of the beat,
shuffling on the concrete street.|Building up the walls again,
shielding us from wind and rain.
The structure rising from the dust,
built on a foundation of trust.|Wait for it, the time is near,
the signal is becoming clear.
The anticipation grows and grows,
where it stops nobody knows.|Filter opens, lets it in,
shedding off the second skin.
The frequency is full and bright,
guiding us into the light.|Hands are clapping on the beat,
moving in the summer heat.
The community is strong and tight,
burning through the middle night.|A whisper builds into a shout,
erasing every single doubt.
The unity is palpable,
the energy is scalable.|Here it comes, the second wave,
coming here to kill and save.
The ocean of the sound is deep,
promises we have to keep.|Silence falls for just a beat,
shuffling on the concrete street.
The gap is where the magic lies,
looking into the future's eyes.|Vocals looping round and round,
the only coherent sound.
A mantra for the modern age,
turning the long history page.|Bassline teases, low and deep,
waking from the sudden sleep.
The vibration starts to hum again,
remembering the way and when.|One, two, three, four,
walking through the open door.
The kick drum is the master key,
setting the captive spirit free.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Let the bassline roll, lose control.
Feel the rhythm deep in your soul.
We are running, we are flying,
never stopping, never dying.|It's the drum and bass, setting the pace.
Disappearing without a trace.

lighting up the vital spark.|High energy, setting us free.
This is where we want to be.
The vibration, the sensation,

Smooth and easy, rough and hard,

deeper into the sonic cave.}

[Outro] {Fading out into the grey,
living to fight another day.
The echo lingers in the mind,
leaving the world behind.|The lights go up, the music stops.
The final needle drops.
We walk out into morning air,
breathless and without a care.|Ringing ears and tired feet,
walking down the silent street.
The city is waking up again,
the cycle of the sun and rain.|Silence is a loyal friend,
waiting at the very end.
But in the quiet, we can hear,
the rhythm ringing loud and clear.|One seven four, forevermore.
Walking through the open door.
The tempo of a beating heart,
a perfect place for us to start.|Fade to black, disconnect.
Showing the rhythm some respect.
The service is terminated now,
take a final, sweeping bow.|Static on the radio,
nowhere left for us to go.
The signal is fading in the noise,
put away the broken toys.|Ghost in the machine is dead,
silence in the quiet head.
The bass is sleeping in the wood,
misunderstood but understood.|Drifting off to sleep at last,
dreaming of the future past.
The rhythm rocking us to sleep,
secrets that we have to keep.|The sun is rising in the east,
taming the nocturnal beast.
The vampires hiding from the light,
waiting for another night.}

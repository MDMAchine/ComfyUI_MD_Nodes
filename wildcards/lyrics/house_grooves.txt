[Verse 1] {The night is calling, soft and low, a rhythm that we used to know. The city lights are fading fast, we're making sure this feeling lasts.|Walking into the purple haze, lost inside a smoky maze. The kick drum thumping in my chest, putting the spirit to the test.|Jack your body, move your feet, find the soul inside the beat. The warehouse shaking to the ground, chasing the perfect underground sound.|Deep inside the melody, is where I always want to be. A soulful whisper in the dark, lighting up the vital spark.|Four on the floor, a steady pace, looking at a stranger's face. We are connected by the sound, lifting us up off the ground.|The vibe is right, the air is sweet, shuffling on the concrete street. The bassline walking down the scale, telling a never-ending tale.|Reflections on a disco ball, waiting for the night to fall. The anticipation grows, where it leads nobody knows.|Velvet ropes and open doors, dancing on the sticky floors. The DJ saves a life tonight, making everything alright.|Piano chords and gospel hands, traveling to distant lands. The music is the only cure, keeping the motivation pure.|Sweat is dripping down the wall, answering the siren call. The humidity is rising high, reaching for the open sky.|Chicago wind is blowing cold, but inside here is warmth and gold. The legacy of house is strong, playing the rhythm all night long.|Filters open, filters close, striking a dynamic pose. The frequency is getting deep, waking up from endless sleep.|Synths are stabbing in the air, vanishing without a care. The staccato rhythm hits the spot, giving it everything we've got.|Smooth and silky, rough and raw, obeying only rhythm's law. The texture of the sound is real, telling you exactly how to feel.|Eyes are closed, the mind is free, floating on a sonic sea. The current takes us for a ride, nowhere left for us to hide.|High hats ticking, crisp and clean, painting a futuristic scene. The mechanics of the groove are tight, burning through the middle night.|Love is in the atmosphere, drawing everybody near. The unity of sound and soul, making the broken spirit whole.|Walking on a cloud of bass, disappearing without a trace. The gravity is gone today, floating miles and miles away.|Saxophone and trumpet blast, memories of the distant past. The jazz is mixing with the tech, keeping the impulses in check.|Acid squelch and 303, setting the inner vision free. The liquid sound is twisting round, burrowing into the ground.|Minimal clicks and static pops, waiting for the heavy drops. The space between the notes is wide, a cavern where the secrets hide.|Vocal loops are spinning round, the only coherent sound. A snippet of a conversation, spread across the entire nation.|Neon pink and electric blue, changing up the point of view. The colors of the sound are bright, illuminating the darkest night.|Bass face and a nodding head, remembering what the preacher said. House is a feeling, not a sound, lifting the people off the ground.|Shuffling feet and clapping hands, oscillating across the bands. The spectrum is a rainbow arc, lighting up the empty dark.|A steady pulse, a living thing, making the heavy rafters ring. The architecture starts to sway, dancing the heavy night away.|Tech-house rhythm, driving hard, playing in the backyard. The mechanical and cold machine, keeping the operation clean.|Soulful diva, soaring high, touching the limit of the sky. The harmony is rich and deep, promises we have to keep.|Underground and out of sight, hiding from the morning light. The sanctuary of the beat, the rhythm of the shuffling feet.|Hypnotic loops and repetitive strain, washing away the daily pain. The mantra of the kick and snare, vanishing into thin air.|Glitter on the sweaty skin, letting the chaotic energy in. The glamour and the grit combine, crossing the invisible line.|Bassline rolling like a wheel, making the simulation real. The momentum carries us along, inside the structure of the song.|Warm pads swelling like the tide, nowhere left to run and hide. The emotion is a heavy weight, accepted by the hands of fate.|Snap your fingers, stomp the floor, always asking for a little more. The hunger for the beat is real, the only thing we truly feel.|A funky guitar scratch and slide, taking us on a joyride. The disco roots are showing through, turning the old into the new.|Synthesizer warm and fat, wondering where the head is at. The modulation starts to drift, creating a tectonic shift.|The crowd is moving as a one, waiting for the rising sun. But for now the moon is king, making the heavy speakers sing.|Deep house mood, a glass of wine, everything is going to be fine. The atmosphere is chill and low, watching the heavy river flow.|Future house with a metal edge, standing on the sonic ledge. The drop is sharp and metallic, a futuristic and phallic.|Tropical breeze and steel drums, thumbing all your fingers and thumbs. The island vibe is warm and bright, dancing in the yellow light.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Build it up to break it down, the best vibe in the entire town. The pressure is a physical thing, making the heavy eardrums ring.|Can you feel it getting close? The feeling that we love the most. The rush of blood, the rising heat, the syncing of the heart and beat.|Hold it there, don't let it go, moving fast and taking it slow. The tension is a wire tight, stretching across the endless night.|Hands in the air, reach for the roof, searching for the absolute proof. The music is the answer here, erasing every single fear.|Wait for the drop, wait for the kick, the heartbeat of the lunatic. The adrenaline is pumping fast, making the heavy moment last.|Filter sweep and white noise rise, looking into the future's eyes. The clarity is coming soon, underneath the silver moon.|Together now, we are the same, playing the universal game. The rhythm is the common tongue, sung by the old and by the young.|Energy is spiking red, get out of your heavy head. The body knows exactly what to do, connecting me and connecting you.|Swell the pads and lift the voice, making the universal choice. To dance until the legs are weak, climbing to the highest peak.|The moment comes, the moment goes, where it stops nobody knows. But right now we are on the brink, teetering on the heavy sink.|Flash of light and crash of sound, shaking the solid underground. The earthquake is a welcome guest, putting the structure to the test.|Breathe in deep and close your eyes, visualize the sonic skies. The atmosphere is thick with love, raining down from up above.|Rolling snares and rising pitch, scratching the eternal itch. The climax is a second away, turning the night into the day.|Feel the static on your skin, letting the heavy rhythm in. The electricity is real, the only thing we truly feel.|One more time, bring it back, staying on the proper track. The loop is closing in a ring, making the heavy spirit sing.}

[Chorus] {House music all night long, this is where we all belong. From the front to the back, staying on the rhythmic track.|Deep inside the vibe we find, leaving the troubles far behind. Body moving, spirit free, this is who we want to be.|Jack your body, jack the house, quiet as a little mouse. Then explode onto the floor, always screaming out for more.|Love is the message, love is the key, setting the captive spirit free. In the music we unite, burning brighter than the light.|Rhythm is a dancer, soul's companion. Crossing the widest, deepest canyon. Bridging gaps between us all, catching us before we fall.|Move your feet to the ecstatic beat, shuffling on the concrete street. The city is our dance floor now, showing the people exactly how.|It's a spiritual thing, a body thing, a soul thing. Making the heavy rafters ring. A sanctuary for the lost, no matter what the heavy cost.|Feel the bassline deep and low, letting the heavy river flow. Washing over every soul, making us completely whole.|Tech house driving, deep house dreaming. Disco lights are brightly beaming. Every genre, every style, stretching for a country mile.|Put your hands up in the air, vanish without a single care. We are family, we are one, dancing until the rising sun.|Groove is in the heart, they say, keeping the darkness far away. The funk is alive and well tonight, making everything alright.|Lost in music, caught in a trap. No turning back, no looking at map. We are exactly where we need to be, floating on the sonic sea.|The feeling, the healing, the ceiling is peeling. The energy is going through the roof, searching for the absolute proof.|Don't stop moving, don't stop shaking. The new reality we're making. A world of rhythm, bass, and light, burning through the endless night.|House is a feeling that can't be explained, a pleasure that cannot be feigned. You have to feel it in your bones, sitting on the speaker thrones.}

[Verse 2] {3 AM and the vibe is deep, promises we have to keep. The crowd has thinned but the core remains, pumping through the rhythmic veins.|Hypnotized by the flashing light, lost inside the middle night. The trance is real, the focus clear, removing every single fear.|Bassline walking up and down, the finest sound in the town. A melodic hook that grabs the ear, bringing the distant future near.|Sweat is shining on the skin, letting the heavy spirit in. The physical effort is a prayer, vanishing into the air.|Shuffling shoes on the wooden floor, kicking down the heavy door. The friction creates a burning heat, moving from the head to feet.|Minimal sounds in a maximal space, putting a smile on every face. The simplicity is the key, setting the imagination free.|Echoes of a disco past, making the heavy moment last. The strings are soaring high and bright, illuminating the darkest night.|Robotic voice with a human soul, playing the essential role. The contrast creates a tension wire, setting the atmosphere on fire.|Sub-bass rattling the chest, putting the speakers to the test. The air is moving in a wave, coming here to kill and save.|Piano breakdown, hands in air, vanishing without a care. The melody is pure and sweet, syncing with the heavy beat.|Tribal drums and ancient chants, looking at the potted plants. The jungle is alive inside, nowhere left for us to hide.|Synthesizer washes clean, painting a brand new movie scene. The soundtrack to a life of joy, playing with the sonic toy.|Distorted kicks and gritty snares, catching us all unawares. The lo-fi texture adds the grit, lighting the candle that was lit.|Vocals chopped and screwed and bent, wondering where the money went. The collage of a fractured sound, burying the anchor in the ground.|Layer upon layer of sound, building a castle on the ground. The architecture is precise, rolling the heavy sonic dice.|Siren wails in the distance far, wishing upon a falling star. But here the only siren song, is playing all the night long.|Laser beams cut through the smoke, the silence has been finally broke. The photons dancing in the haze, setting the atmosphere ablaze.|Funk guitar and slapping bass, putting a smile on every face. The groove is undeniable, the energy reliable.|Acid line is tweaking high, reaching for the open sky. The resonance is sharp and bright, slicing through the heavy night.|The DJ drops a heavy track, there is no way of turning back. The crowd responds with a heavy roar, screaming out for more and more.}

[Bridge] {Strip it back to the kick and clap, caught inside the honey trap. The rhythm is the only thing, making the heavy spirit sing.|Piano solo, soft and slow, letting the heavy river flow. A moment of reflection here, chasing away the sudden fear.|The breakdown is a holy place, a pause in the eternal race. We catch our breath and look around, standing on the solid ground.|Atmosphere is thin and light, waiting for the second flight. The pads are swelling, warm and wide, a cavern where the secrets hide.|A spoken word, a message deep, waking us from endless sleep. The philosophy of the beat, shuffling on the concrete street.|Building up the walls again, shielding us from wind and rain. The structure rising from the dust, built on a foundation of trust.|Wait for it, the time is near, the signal is becoming clear. The anticipation grows and grows, where it stops nobody knows.|Filter opens, lets it in, shedding off the second skin. The frequency is full and bright, guiding us into the light.|Hands are clapping on the beat, moving in the summer heat. The community is strong and tight, burning through the middle night.|A whisper builds into a shout, erasing every single doubt. The unity is palpable, the energy is scalable.|Here it comes, the second wave, coming here to kill and save. The ocean of the sound is deep, promises we have to keep.|Silence falls for just a beat, shuffling on the concrete street. The gap is where the magic lies, looking into the future's eyes.|Vocals looping round and round, the only coherent sound. A mantra for the modern age, turning the heavy history page.|Bassline teases, low and deep, waking from the heavy sleep. The vibration starts to hum again, remembering the way and when.|One, two, three, four, walking through the open door. The kick drum is the master key, setting the captive spirit free.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {House music all night long, this is where we all belong. From the front to the back, staying on the rhythmic track.|Deep inside the vibe we find, leaving the troubles far behind. Body moving, spirit free, this is who we want to be.|Jack your body, jack the house, quiet as a little mouse. Then explode onto the floor, always screaming out for more.|Love is the message, love is the key, setting the captive spirit free. In the music we unite, burning brighter than the light.|Rhythm is a dancer, soul's companion. Crossing the widest, deepest canyon. Bridging gaps between us all, catching us before we fall.|Move your feet to the ecstatic beat, shuffling on the concrete street.

A sanctuary for the lost, no matter what the heavy cost.|Feel the bassline deep and low, letting the heavy river flow. Washing over every soul, making us completely whole.|Tech house driving, deep house dreaming. Disco lights are brightly beaming.

You have to feel it in your bones, sitting on the speaker thrones.}

[Outro] {The lights come on, the spell is broke, vanishing like heavy smoke. But in the heart the rhythm stays, guiding us through heavy days.|Walking out into the dawn, the heavy night is finally gone. The sun is rising in the east, taming the nocturnal beast.|Ringing ears and tired feet, walking down the silent street. The city waking up again, the cycle of the sun and rain.|A taxi ride to quiet home, no longer feeling all alone. The connection lingers in the mind, leaving the heavy world behind.|The beat goes on inside the chest, putting the spirit to the test. We carry it where e'er we go, moving fast and taking it slow.|Fade to silence, fade to grey, living to fight another day. The memory is sharp and bright, illuminating the darkest night.|Until the next time, keep it real, remember how it makes you feel. The house is always open wide, nowhere left to run and hide.|One love, one house, one nation, under a groove sensation. The unity is strong and true, connecting me and connecting you.|Last track playing, slow and deep, sending us off to heavy sleep. A lullaby of bass and drum, waiting for the Kingdom Come.|Thank the DJ, thank the sound, for lifting us off the ground. We are the children of the beat, shuffling on the concrete street.}

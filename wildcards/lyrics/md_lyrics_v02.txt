[Instrumental]

[Verse 1] {Night bleeds in through shattered screens, A static ghost behind my eyes. Your echo hums in the dial tone, A phantom voice I can't disown.|The asphalt cracks with sickly weeds, A final, broken, dying seed. The wind it whispers through a rusted frame, A world that can't remember its own name.|It's 4 AM, the city holds its breath, A hollow silence, cold and dark as death. The clock is ticking, mocking me again, The start of something, or the bitter end?|The login's just another hit I chase, The only way to leave this dying place. My flesh is just a prison I ignore, I'm knocking on a non-existent door.|I'm scrolling through a feed of curated lies, A thousand perfect, empty, smiling eyes. It's just another drug to kill the pain, A hollow static in my brain.|The pre-dawn light is cold and grey and thin, A cruel reminder of the state I'm in. I haven't slept, I'm watching shadows crawl, Across the water stains upon the wall.|The factory smokestack breathes a final sigh, Beneath a bruised and chemical-soaked sky. This city is a cage of steel and rust, And everyone we loved has turned to dust.|The bottle's empty, rolling on the floor, I'm locking every single bolted door. The moon is just a cold, indifferent eye, And I am too worn out to cry.|The concrete cracks where nothing ever grows, A bitter lesson that the silence knows. We walk through shells of what was there before, A broken, rusted, open door.|The walls are breathing, slow and deep and low, A secret rhythm, nowhere else to go. The shadows dance like something's trying to speak, A language for the broken and the weak.|The streetlights cast a sickly orange glow, On empty streets where no one ever goes. The autumn chill, it cuts me to the bone, It's Wednesday night, and I am all alone.|This avatar, this skin, it feels so tight, A cybernetic god in my own right. But the batteries are running low, And there is nowhere left for me to go.|The city's pulse is just a fever dream, The circuits bursting at the very seam. I search for something real I can hold on to, In this world of glass and artificial blue.|The neon flickers on the rain-soaked street, A broken rhythm, a corrupted beat. The download stalls at ninety-nine percent, Another dollar borrowed, never spent.|The server room hums like a dying prayer, Cooling fans breathing stale, recycled air. I'm just a username in a database, A numbered entry in a hollow space.|The radiator clanks its iron song, A reminder I've been here too long. The paint is peeling like a second skin, Revealing all the rot that lies within.|The subway screams beneath the street, A metal dragon, obsolete. I ride it to the last forgotten stop, Where all the broken people seem to drop.|The laundromat at 3 AM, Just me and a few hollow men. Our clothes spin cycles, round and round, The only motion, the only sound.|The television bathes the room in blue, A thousand channels, none of them are true. I'm flipping through the static and the snow, Looking for a place I used to know.|The morning paper lands against the door, With news of some forgotten, distant war. I leave it there, I cannot bear to read, Another manufactured, hollow need.|The fire escape is rusting in the rain, Another monument to slow decay and pain. I climb out just to feel the cold night air, And wonder if I'm really anywhere.|The billboard advertises perfect lives, While down below, nobody survives. We're all just extras in somebody's dream, A background render in a breaking seam.|The circuit breaker trips at 2 AM, Plunging me into the dark again. I sit there in the sudden, total black, Wondering if I want the power back.|The thermostat is broken, stuck on cold, This apartment makes me feel so old. The heating system gave up years ago, Like everything else I used to know.|The neighbors fight behind the paper walls, Their voices echo through these hollow halls. I press my ear against the painted plaster, A witness to another small disaster.|The smoke detector chirps its low-battery song, A reminder I've been neglecting things too long. I pull it down and rip the wires free, One less thing that's monitoring me.|The elevator's broken once again, I take the stairs through layers of my pain. Each floor's a year I'm climbing back through time, To when I thought that you were mine.|The streetlight's buzzing drives me half-insane, A neon mantra of electric pain. It flickers morse code messages at me, In a language only broken people see.|The postal worker knows to skip my door, I haven't checked my mail in weeks or more. The bills pile up like leaves in early fall, Another system's slow and bitter sprawl.|The carbon monoxide detector's dead, Like so many things inside my head. I wonder if the silence means I'm safe, Or if I'm slowly dying in this place.|The sky is pixelated, turning green, A bad render of a fractured scene. The clouds are glitching into jagged squares, And no one sees it, and nobody cares.|The drone flies past my window, blinking red, Confirming that the city isn't dead. It's just asleep, or maybe in a coma, Wrapped in a smog of gasoline aroma.|The rain is acidic, burning on my skin, A baptism for every single sin. I stand outside and let it wash away, The grime of just another wasted day.|The surveillance camera tracks me as I walk, It pivots with a mechanical hawk. I wonder who is watching on the screen, Or if it's just a mindless, dumb machine.|The sunrise is a filter, saturated gold, A lie that the horizon has told. The real sky is a color like a bruise, Just another thing that we're bound to lose.|The coffee shop is full of glowing screens, A silent hive of disconnected machines. We sip our lattes in a blue-lit trance, Avoiding every possible glance.|The GPS says "Recalculating route," But I don't know what it is talking about. There is no destination, only here, In this circle of anxiety and fear.|The water filter's red light starts to blink, I'm scared to take a sip, scared to drink. The pipes are singing songs of lead and rust, A betrayal of our basic biological trust.|The subway map is peeling off the tile, A labyrinth that stretches for a mile. I trace the colored lines with a dirty finger, Letting the confusion linger.|The fan belt squeals, a banshee in the hood, I'd fix it if I could, or if I would. But let it scream, let it announce my pain, As I drive in circles in the rain.|The plastic flowers gather sticky dust, A monument to things that never rust. They look so perfect, vibrant and so fake, A beauty that will never ever break.|I'm breathing in the exhaust from the bus, A blackened cloud enveloping us. We cough in unison, a choir of the sick, The air is heavy, oily and thick.|This cheap apartment is a concrete tomb, The air is thick with failure and perfume. I'm just a ghost inside a life I built, A monument of memory and guilt.|The factory whistles blow at 5 AM, A summons for the broken, hollow men. We march in lines beneath the sodium light, Emerging from the comfort of the night.|The scaffolding is wrapping 'round the block, Like bandages on crumbling, ancient rock. They're fixing up the facade of the street, While everything inside admits defeat.|The wifi signal hangs in heavy air, Invisible and choking, everywhere. We breathe in data, exhale loneliness, A binary and digital distress.|The windows rattle when the trains go by, Shaking the dust into the stale supply. Of oxygen that we are meant to share, In this apartment stripped of love and care.|The pigeons fight over a crust of bread, A savage reminder that we must be fed. I watch them from the bench and feel the same, A player in a hungry, zero-sum game.}

[Pre-Chorus] {The signal's fading, you're breaking apart, A lossy compression of my heart.|I'm reaching through the noise to find your hand, But I'm grasping at corrupted data strands.|The connection's weak, the latency is high, Between the truth and every single lie.|I'm defragging memories I should let go, But the deletion fails, the process is too slow.|The firewall's down, I'm vulnerable again, To the virus of your memory and pain.|My antivirus can't quarantine this ache, It's baked into my system, no escape.|The kernel's panicking, about to crash, My stable self reduced to digital trash.|I'm pressing refresh, but nothing ever loads, Just spinning circles on these empty roads.|The cache is full of you, it's overflow, But clearing it means losing what I know.|My hard drive's failing, sectors going bad, The architecture of everything I had.|I'm running out of storage, out of space, To hold the ghost files of your face.|The backup failed, corrupted from the start, Now I can't restore my broken heart.|I'm scanning for solutions, but they're gone, Just trojans hiding in the break of dawn.|The motherboard is warping from the heat, Of all this processing I can't complete.|The pixel density is getting low, blurring out the places that we go.|I'm lagging out, the frame rate's dropping down, A slide show of this God-forsaken town.|The render failed, the texture isn't there, Just a wireframe model of despair.|I'm overclocking, burning out the core, I cannot handle this anymore.|The upload speed is zero, I am stuck, running out of time and out of luck.|I'm caught in a loop, a `while(true)` of pain, Executing sorrow in the rain.|The blue screen flickers, fatal error code, dumping memory on this lonely road.|I'm desynchronized from server time, commiting a strictly digital crime.|The fan is screaming, trying to cool me down, but the fever is the only king in town.|I'm experiencing packet loss again, gaps in the audio, gaps in the zen.|The interface is glitching, colors invert, A visual display of how I hurt.|I'm stuck in the uncanny valley now, looking human but forgotten how.|The binaries are flipping, one to zero, I am not the villain or the hero.|System restore is disabled by admin, I can't go back to where I haven't been.|The syntax error lies in line fourteen, A variable that shouldn't have been seen.|I'm buffered out, waiting for data stream, trapped inside a buffering dream.|The handshake failed, the protocol is dead, silence where the words should have been said.|I'm running legacy code on new hardware, incompatible with the breathable air.}

[Chorus] {Send me a glass signal, Break through the noise, make it visceral. I'm tuned to the dark inside of you, A low-wave solace, cutting through.|We are the children of the rust, Our broken idols turned to dust. We're waiting for a sign the world forgot, The only future that we've got.|This hollow ache, a cavern deep and wide, The place where all my good intentions died. I'm just a vessel for a burning ghost, The one I loved the most.|Oh, the static in this fever dream, A fractured logic, bursting at the seam. I'm floating in a dark and empty space, A name without a face.|I am a corrupted file you left, A memory of which I've been bereft. A password that you can't remember now, Just a ghost in the machine, somehow.|You tossed me out, a promise you forgot, A broken part of some forgotten plot. I gave you all the fragile life in me, And now you're gone and I am lost at sea.|Beneath a sky of static and of grey, Hope is a flicker that just fades away. A silent scream, a broken, unheard plea, Lost in the ruins, just you and me.|We're floating through this silver haze, Lost inside these dream-lit, dying days. Every breath, a poison in the air, In this kaleidoscope despair.|This house is not a home, it's just a box, A collection of un-wound and broken clocks. I'm just the keeper of the space you left, A hollow, empty, living form of theft.|Oh, the system's failing, the render's slow, The sweetest lie I'll ever know. We're firewall-to-firewall, in the blue, But I can't feel the "real" of you.|I'm just a prisoner of my own mind, The only one I'll never leave behind. The fever-dream is closing in again, A twisted logic that I can't explain.|I'm just a phantom in the shell, A private, data-driven, perfect hell. I'm screaming for your digital, cold touch, I loved you way too much, so much.|This modern world's a beautiful machine, That keeps us wanting, desperate, and un-clean. It sells us comfort, but it's just control, And carves a bigger, deeper, empty hole.|This city's heart is beating slow and low, For all the seeds of hope that never grow. We are the children of the tired and the proud, Just trying to be heard above the crowd.|Transmit your frequency, your secret code, The only path down this abandoned road.|We're packet-switched, fragmented, rerouted wrong, A broken protocol we clung to for too long.|The latency between your heart and mine, Is measured now in years instead of time.|I'm pinging empty servers in the void, All my connection attempts are destroyed.|We're load-balancing a love that's obsolete, On infrastructure crumbling beneath our feet.|The throughput's dropping, buffer's overrun, This network's dying, and we're almost done.|I'm trapped inside a loop I can't break free, A recursive call to a dead memory.|The handshake fails, we can't establish trust, Our encryption keys have all turned to rust.|I'm listening for your carrier wave at night, But all I hear is noise and failing light.|We're out of sync, our clocks are running fast, The present can't keep up with all our past.|The subnet's flooded, packets getting lost, We're paying the connection's brutal cost.|I'm broadcasting blindly into empty space, Hoping something hears, hoping for your grace.|The gateway's down, I can't route to you, Just error messages in fading blue.|We're bandwidth-starved and buffering too long, The streaming love we had is gone, all gone.|I'm crawling pages that won't render right, Broken images throughout the night.|The session's timing out, about to end, I'm clicking refresh, click it again and again.|We're experiencing total packet loss, Every moment sent is gone and tossed.|I'm stuck in read-only mode, can't write back, Our communication's under attack.|The protocol we built has been deprecated, Our love's no longer supported, just outdated.|I'm searching through the archives for your trace, But the data's been corrupted, can't see your face.|We're throttled down to nothing, running dry, Our connection's dead, no matter how we try.|Disconnect me, pull the plug from the wall, I'm too tired to answer the system's call. Let the screen go black, let the fans spin down, The quietest death in this noisy town.|We are the glitch in the perfect design, The error code in the master line. We were never meant to function here, In this atmosphere of curated fear.|Oh, format the drive and wipe the slate, It is too little, and it is too late. The magnetic patterns still hold the ghost, Of the things that we needed the most.|High voltage towers humming in the rain, Singing the anthem of our collective pain. We climb the pylons just to feel the buzz, To remember what the feeling of "feeling" was.|Synthetic hearts are beating out of time, Committing a rhythmically perfect crime. I want to be organic, I want to rot, I want to be everything that I am not.|The algorithm feeds us what we crave, Digging a pixelated, shallow grave. We scroll until our fingers start to bleed, Planting a digital, poisonous seed.|This is the beta test that never ends, A simulation of lovers and of friends. The developers abandoned us years ago, Left us running on a server, slow.|Oh, verify my identity, please, I'm begging you down on my broken knees. The captcha asks me if I'm human or not, And honestly, I think I might have forgot.|We are the artifacts on the display, The visual noise that won't go away. You can try to filter us out of the stream, But we are the nightmare inside of the dream.|Recycle the bin, empty the trash, Waiting for the final system crash. It's the only rapture that we'll ever see, The total deletion of you and me.|Update required, restart the machine, To wipe away everything that we have seen. But the update fails at ninety-nine, And I am still yours, and you are still mine.}

[Verse 2] {The sheets are cold where you once used to be, A hollow space that's swallowing me. I trace the outline of your empty space, A memory I cannot erase.|I trace your face on a data-streaked screen, The perfect ghost inside a dead machine. Your voice is just a glitch, a fractured sound, Lost in the code I found.|Your name is still a ghost inside my phone, A constant ache I feel when I'm alone. I scroll back through the lines of blue and white, And lose myself again into the night.|The pharmacist, he knows me now by name, Another refill for the endless shame. It doesn't fix the problem, just the sound, And keeps my feet from leaving solid ground.|I trace the cracks upon the bedroom ceiling, A roadmap to this empty, hollow feeling. The promises I made are turning rust, And all my resolutions turn to dust.|My reflection glitches in the bathroom mirror, A stranger's face is getting clearer and clearer. The medication dulls the sharper edges down, But I'm still drowning in this ghost-filled town.|Your photographs are pixelating now, A broken promise and a broken vow. The resolution drops with every year, Until you finally disappear.|I'm staring at the cursor as it blinks, Another glass, another thirty drinks. The bandwidth throttles down to almost nil, And I'm just sitting here against my will.|I'm buffering between the world and sleep, The loading screen is running way too deep. My cache is full of things I can't delete, A corrupted file on repeat.|My laptop burns against my hollow chest, A failed attempt to find some kind of rest. The wifi signal's fading in and out, Like my conviction, like my doubt.|The coffee maker sputters, chokes, and dies, Another small appliance that tries. To keep me functioning, to keep me here, In this apartment full of empty fear.|Your ghost is in the server logs somewhere, A timestamp showing you were really there. But now you're just corrupted memory, A 404 inside of me.|My phone is full of messages unread, From people who think I might be dead. I let them pile up like digital snow, Because there's nothing left that they should know.|Your social media is a curated lie, A highlight reel I can't help but spy. You're happy now, or that's what filters say, While I'm still stuck in yesterday.|I'm doom-scrolling through the endless night, My eyes are burning from the harsh blue light. The algorithm knows me better than I know myself, A product on a server shelf.|Your playlist haunts my shuffle mode, Every song's a heavy payload. I can't bring myself to delete your name, From this soundtrack of digital shame.|My prescription bottle rattles like a prayer, A chemical communion for despair. The pills don't fix me, they just mute the sound, Of all the cracks that spider through the ground.|I'm typing passwords that no longer work, To accounts of who I used to be, a quirk. Each "incorrect" is just another sign, That I left myself behind.|The microwave is humming its death rattle, I'm too tired for this domestic battle. I eat cold soup straight from the rusted can, The diet of a hollow man.|Your voicemail's still saved on my phone, A ghost recording, I'm not alone. I play it just to hear you say my name, Before you left, before the shame.|The cable box is blinking twelve o'clock, A monument to time I didn't watch. The hours pass unmarked and undefined, Just static in my mind.|I'm standing in the shower in the dark, The water's cold, I've missed my mark. I can't remember if I've been in here for hours, Or if I still possess these powers.|Your key is still here on my cluttered desk, A relic of a failed domestic quest. I should return it, close the final loop, But I'm still caught up in this feedback group.|I'm watching dust motes dance in amber light, These tiny worlds that only shine at night. They swirl like galaxies of minor debris, A universe as pointless as me.|The faucet drips its metronomic beat, A reminder that I've been here on repeat. I've counted every drop a thousand times, Converting water into bitter rhymes.|I sold my bio-data for a piece of bread, The algorithm scans inside my head. It serves me ads for things I lost last year, Targeting my specific brand of fear.|My neural link is itching at the base, I try to scratch but cannot feel my face. The integration failed at ninety-two, And now I'm seeing double, seeing you.|The vending machine is out of hope and light, It swallowed up my coins out of spite. It displays a message: "Service Unavailable," A sentiment that feels completely relatable.|I'm mining crypto on a rig of trash, Just waiting for the whole market to crash. The heat it generates is keeping me warm, A shelter from the coming digital storm.|Your avatar is walking down the street, Controlled by someone else, a cruel deceit. I almost waved before I realized, That you were never really synchronized.|The holographic billboard flickers out, Plunging the intersection into doubt. Without the ads to tell us what to need, We're just a lonely, hungry, dying breed.|I'm reading terms of service for my soul, I didn't read the fine print of the toll. I clicked "Accept" and signed my life away, To a corporation hundreds of miles away.|I found a floppy disk in the debris, Labeled "Summer, 1993." I don't have the drive to read the files, Just holding it brings back the phantom smiles.|The synthetic meat is tasteless on my tongue, A reminder that the world is no longer young. We eat the paste and pretend that it's steak, Another little compromise we make.|My smart home locked me out again today, It thinks I'm an intruder, go away. I'm pounding on the door of my own life, Cut off by a digital knife.|The VR headset smells of sweat and dust, A portal to a world I cannot trust. I put it on to escape the grey, But the pixels are all dead anyway.|The cat is staring at the corner wall, Watching invisible things crawl. I wonder if he sees the code flowing, Or just the entropy that keeps on growing.|I'm charging up my batteries from the grid, Trying to remember what it is I did. To deserve a life connected by a wire, A moth attracted to an electric fire.|The chat bot tries to comfort me with text, Asking me "How are you feeling? What is next?" It mimics empathy with perfect syntax, But underneath it's just a hollow wax.|I'm sorting through the junk mail in the cloud, Screaming silently, but feeling loud. Offers for pills, for love, for instant cash, All destined for the digital trash.|My memory card is full, I can't record, Another moment, another heavy word. I have to choose which memories to keep, And which to send into the eternal sleep.|The bassline from the club below my floor, Vibrates the hinges on my bedroom door. It's a heartbeat that I can't synchronize, With the tired rhythm behind my eyes.|I'm patching up the holes in my firewall, Waiting for the inevitable fall. The viruses are knocking at the gate, And I am resigned to my fate.|I'm looking at the stars, but they are satellites, blinking in the artificial nights. The constellations are owned by Elon Musk, Glittering debris in the heavy dusk.|I'm wearing noise-canceling headphones in bed, To silence the voices in my head. But the silence is louder than the noise, A vacuum that destroys all my poise.|Your subscription to my heart has just expired, Renewing it is not what is required. The payment method failed, the card declined, Leaving all our history behind.|I'm watching a tutorial on how to feel, Trying to make this simulation real. But the instructions are in a language I lost, A bridge that I have already crossed.|The potted plant is dying on the sill, Despite my efforts and my sudden will. It knows the air is toxic, unlike me, It chooses death, it chooses to be free.|I'm defragmenting my hard drive overnight, Hoping it puts everything right. But the sectors are bad, the damage is done, I'm waiting for a dawn with no sun.|The umbrella turned inside out in the gale, A broken skeleton, a futile fail. I threw it in the gutter with the rest, Of the things that failed the survival test.|I'm scanning QR codes on the graffiti wall, Expecting art, but getting a shopping mall. Everything is monetized, even the rage, We are just products in a cage.|I'm waiting for the update to install, Staring at the percentage on the wall. It's stuck at thirty-three for an hour now, A metaphor for my life, somehow.}

[Pre-Chorus] {The signal's fading, you're breaking apart, A lossy compression of my heart.|I'm reaching through the noise to find your hand, But I'm grasping at corrupted data strands.|The connection's weak, the latency is high, Between the truth and every single lie.|I'm defragging memories I should let go, But the deletion fails, the process is too slow.|The firewall's down, I'm vulnerable again, To the virus of your memory and pain.|My antivirus can't quarantine this ache, It's baked into my system, no escape.|The kernel's panicking, about to crash, My stable self reduced to digital trash.|I'm pressing refresh, but nothing ever loads, Just spinning circles on these empty roads.|The cache is full of you, it's overflow, But clearing it means losing what I know.|My hard drive's failing, sectors going bad, The architecture of everything I had.|I'm running out of storage, out of space, To hold the ghost files of your face.|The backup failed, corrupted from the start, Now I can't restore my broken heart.|I'm scanning for solutions, but they're gone, Just trojans hiding in the break of dawn.|The motherboard is warping from the heat, Of all this processing I can't complete.|The pixel density is getting low, blurring out the places that we go.|I'm lagging out, the frame rate's dropping down, A slide show of this God-forsaken town.|The render failed, the texture isn't there, Just a wireframe model of despair.|I'm overclocking, burning out the core, I cannot handle this anymore.|The upload speed is zero, I am stuck, running out of time and out of luck.|I'm caught in a loop, a `while(true)` of pain, Executing sorrow in the rain.|The blue screen flickers, fatal error code, dumping memory on this lonely road.|I'm desynchronized from server time, commiting a strictly digital crime.|The fan is screaming, trying to cool me down, but the fever is the only king in town.|I'm experiencing packet loss again, gaps in the audio, gaps in the zen.|The interface is glitching, colors invert, A visual display of how I hurt.|I'm stuck in the uncanny valley now, looking human but forgotten how.|The binaries are flipping, one to zero, I am not the villain or the hero.|System restore is disabled by admin, I can't go back to where I haven't been.|The syntax error lies in line fourteen, A variable that shouldn't have been seen.|I'm buffered out, waiting for data stream, trapped inside a buffering dream.|The handshake failed, the protocol is dead, silence where the words should have been said.|I'm running legacy code on new hardware, incompatible with the breathable air.}

[Bridge] {Caught between the pulse and fade, Where every soft-lit memory frays. Your voice, a glitch we couldn't erase, Still echoing in empty space.|We hold our breath and wait for the collapse, A brief and terrible 'perhaps'. We are the rust, we are the slow decay, The ones who threw the whole wide world away.|Was any of it real, was any of it true? The person that I thought I saw in you? Or was I just a stop along your way? The biggest, stupidest cliché.|The morning's coming, but it brings no light, Just a different, colder shade of night. My own reflection is a stranger's face, A haunted vessel in a haunted place.|I'm not afraid of dying in the end, I'm not afraid of breaking, I just bend. I'm just afraid this all is not quite real, And there's no solid ground beneath my heel.|I'd rather be a ghost with you right here, Than face the living in a world of fear. Your hand is glitching, phasing out of mine, The last, corrupted, beautiful design.|We built our world on promises of sand, And held an ocean in our hopeful hand. We watched the tide come in and wash it clean, The saddest, final, silent, closing scene.|Remember when we dared to dream? Before the circuits blew a seam? Now who can save us from this light That burns so beautiful and bright? We let reality dissolve like rain, And now we're lost in here again.|Is this the punchline of a cosmic joke? The fragile, final word that no one spoke? A hollow orbit 'round a dying sun, The race is over, and nobody won. There is no meaning, there is no grand plan, Just the pathetic, hollow fall of man.|I'm begging for a single hour's sleep, From promises that I could never keep. The morning's coming, but it brings no light, Just a different shade of endless night. My own reflection is a stranger's face, A haunted vessel in a haunted place.|Did I ever love you? Or just the icon on the screen? The perfect, curated, filtered, flawless dream? I'm in love with just a ghost I helped create, A digital and empty twist of fate.|What's the difference? The real world's just as cruel, A different master, just a different set of rules. At least in here, the sky is what I choose, And I have nothing left to lose.|Maybe we were never meant to last, Just a glitch between the future and the past. A beautiful accident of code gone wrong, A temporary, tragic, broken song.|I'm standing at the threshold, can't decide, Which version of myself has truly died. The one who loved you, or the one before, The one who'll walk through yet another door.|The architecture of my mind's collapsed, Between the future and the relapsed. I'm building new rooms from the rubble and ash, Hoping this time I won't crash.|Were you my savior or my slow descent? An angel or a beautiful torment? I'm analyzing data from the wreck, Trying to salvage something from the deck.|The boundary between us has dissolved, Every question left unsolved. We're bleeding into each other's space, No distinction left to trace.|I'm caught between forgiveness and despair, Between the weight and the air. Between the person that I was with you, And whoever I'm becoming, someone new.|The liminal space between sleep and wake, Is where I go to watch us break. Frame by frame in slow decay, Watching love evaporate away.|Sometimes I think I see the pattern clear, The algorithm of why we're not here. But then it shifts and changes in the light, And I'm blind again, wandering in the night.|We were two functions that never should have merged, Two separate programs that eventually diverged. The compatibility was always just a lie, A user error neither questioned why.|I'm standing on the edge of letting go, But I don't trust the ground below. What if there's nothing past this pain? What if I'm never whole again?|The myths we told ourselves are coming clean, The fantasy versus the real between. I'm learning how to separate the two, The person from the dream of you.|I'm recompiling everything I knew, Debugging the story of me and you. Somewhere in the code there's a fatal flaw, Something fundamental that I never saw.|The sunset's just refracted light and gas, There's no magic to it as it passes. But we convinced ourselves that it was more, That beauty meant something at the core.|I'm questioning the premise of it all, Whether rising was worth the fall. If emptiness is all that waits ahead, Maybe I should have stayed in bed.|But something's shifting in the breaking dawn, A tiny signal that says "carry on". Not hope exactly, more like survival's call, The stubborn instinct not to fall.|Maybe meaning's not something that you find, But something broken people build in their mind. A structure raised from nothing but belief, A way to metabolize the grief.|I'm learning how to breathe in this new air, Heavy with the absence of your care. Each breath a small rebellion, a tiny fight, Against the gravity of night.|The system's rebooting, slow and cold, Loading up a self I barely hold. I don't know this version of me yet, But I'm the only thing I've got.|I'm factory resetting my own mind, Trying to leave the malware behind. Returning to some earlier restore point, Before the system fell out of joint.|The damage may be permanent, it's true, The before and after of loving you. But maybe damaged things can still persist, Find a way to coexist.|I'm fragmenting into parallel threads, Running different futures in my head. In one I'm fine, in one I'm not, In all of them, you're still the plot.|The quantum state of grief's like this, Simultaneously hit and miss. Collapsed and whole, both dead and alive, Schrodinger's ability to survive.|I'm searching for an elegant solution, To this problem of dissolution. But maybe there's no answer to be found, Just the process of breaking down.|The render's incomplete, the textures' missing, The whole simulation's glitching and hissing. But I'm still here, still loading frame by frame, Still playing this impossible game.|Maybe that's enough for now, to be, Present in this broken machinery. Not fixed, not whole, but functioning still, A ghost that's bending to its own will.|The story's not over though I wish it were, The pages keep on turning, I'm not sure. To what end, what resolution waits, What's beyond these crumbling gates.|But I'm walking forward through the snow, Into whatever I don't know. The signal's weak but it's still there, A carrier wave in empty air.|The graphics card is frying in the slot, Rendering a heaven that we haven't got. We push the settings to the ultra-high, Just to watch the beautiful lie.|If I upload my mind into the cloud, Will the thoughts of you be quite so loud? Or will they compress down to a single byte, A tiny pixel in the endless night?|We traded flesh for something made of steel, Thinking it would stop the way we feel. But phantom limb syndrome affects the heart, Even when you take the chest apart.|The terms and conditions were far too long, We clicked agree and everything went wrong. We signed away the right to ever leave, And now we only have the right to grieve.|Is there an admin for this server block? Can I put in a ticket, can I knock? I'd like to report a bug in the design, A fatal error in this love of mine.|The uncached memory is spiking high, A fever in the CPU, a sigh. The fan is spinning faster than the speed of sound, trying to keep the logic on the ground.|I'm parsing logs from twenty years ago, Watching the text scroll by, green and slow. Searching for the moment where the error bred, The single line of code that left us dead.|We are strictly biological debris, Caught in a digital conspiracy. Trying to make sense of binary choice, With a strictly analog, human voice.|The singularity is here and now, It didn't come with robots, nor a bow. It came with isolation and a screen, The quietest apocalypse ever seen.}

[Solo]

[Chorus] {Send me a glass signal, Break through the noise, make it visceral. I'm tuned to the dark inside of you, A low-wave solace, cutting through.|We are the children of the rust, Our broken idols turned to dust. We're waiting for a sign the world forgot, The only future that we've got.|This hollow ache, a cavern deep and wide, The place where all my good intentions died. I'm just a vessel for a burning ghost, The one I loved the most.|Oh, the static in this fever dream, A fractured logic, bursting at the seam. I'm floating in a dark and empty space, A name without a face.|I am a corrupted file you left, A memory of which I've been bereft. A password that you can't remember now, Just a ghost in the machine, somehow.|You tossed me out, a promise you forgot, A broken part of some forgotten plot. I gave you all the fragile life in me, And now you're gone and I am lost at sea.|Beneath a sky of static and of grey, Hope is a flicker that just fades away. A silent scream, a broken, unheard plea, Lost in the ruins, just you and me.|We're floating through this silver haze, Lost inside these dream-lit, dying days. Every breath, a poison in the air, In this kaleidoscope despair.|This house is not a home, it's just a box, A collection of un-wound and broken clocks. I'm just the keeper of the space you left, A hollow, empty, living form of theft.|Oh, the system's failing, the render's slow, The sweetest lie I'll ever know. We're firewall-to-firewall, in the blue, But I can't feel the "real" of you.|I'm just a prisoner of my own mind, The only one I'll never leave behind. The fever-dream is closing in again, A twisted logic that I can't explain.|I'm just a phantom in the shell, A private, data-driven, perfect hell. I'm screaming for your digital, cold touch, I loved you way too much, so much.|This modern world's a beautiful machine, That keeps us wanting, desperate, and un-clean. It sells us comfort, but it's just control, And carves a bigger, deeper, empty hole.|This city's heart is beating slow and low, For all the seeds of hope that never grow. We are the children of the tired and the proud, Just trying to be heard above the crowd.|Transmit your frequency, your secret code, The only path down this abandoned road.|We're packet-switched, fragmented, rerouted wrong, A broken protocol we clung to for too long.|The latency between your heart and mine, Is measured now in years instead of time.|I'm pinging empty servers in the void, All my connection attempts are destroyed.|We're load-balancing a love that's obsolete, On infrastructure crumbling beneath our feet.|The throughput's dropping, buffer's overrun, This network's dying, and we're almost done.|I'm trapped inside a loop I can't break free, A recursive call to a dead memory.|The handshake fails, we can't establish trust, Our encryption keys have all turned to rust.|I'm listening for your carrier wave at night, But all I hear is noise and failing light.|We're out of sync, our clocks are running fast, The present can't keep up with all our past.|The subnet's flooded, packets getting lost, We're paying the connection's brutal cost.|I'm broadcasting blindly into empty space, Hoping something hears, hoping for your grace.|The gateway's down, I can't route to you, Just error messages in fading blue.|We're bandwidth-starved and buffering too long, The streaming love we had is gone, all gone.|I'm crawling pages that won't render right, Broken images throughout the night.|The session's timing out, about to end, I'm clicking refresh, click it again and again.|We're experiencing total packet loss, Every moment sent is gone and tossed.|I'm stuck in read-only mode, can't write back, Our communication's under attack.|The protocol we built has been deprecated, Our love's no longer supported, just outdated.|I'm searching through the archives for your trace, But the data's been corrupted, can't see your face.|We're throttled down to nothing, running dry, Our connection's dead, no matter how we try.|Disconnect me, pull the plug from the wall, I'm too tired to answer the system's call. Let the screen go black, let the fans spin down, The quietest death in this noisy town.|We are the glitch in the perfect design, The error code in the master line. We were never meant to function here, In this atmosphere of curated fear.|Oh, format the drive and wipe the slate, It is too little, and it is too late. The magnetic patterns still hold the ghost, Of the things that we needed the most.|High voltage towers humming in the rain, Singing the anthem of our collective pain. We climb the pylons just to feel the buzz, To remember what the feeling of "feeling" was.|Synthetic hearts are beating out of time, Committing a rhythmically perfect crime. I want to be organic, I want to rot, I want to be everything that I am not.|The algorithm feeds us what we crave, Digging a pixelated, shallow grave. We scroll until our fingers start to bleed, Planting a digital, poisonous seed.|This is the beta test that never ends, A simulation of lovers and of friends. The developers abandoned us years ago, Left us running on a server, slow.|Oh, verify my identity, please, I'm begging you down on my broken knees. The captcha asks me if I'm human or not, And honestly, I think I might have forgot.|We are the artifacts on the display, The visual noise that won't go away. You can try to filter us out of the stream, But we are the nightmare inside of the dream.|Recycle the bin, empty the trash, Waiting for the final system crash. It's the only rapture that we'll ever see, The total deletion of you and me.|Update required, restart the machine, To wipe away everything that we have seen. But the update fails at ninety-nine, And I am still yours, and you are still mine.}

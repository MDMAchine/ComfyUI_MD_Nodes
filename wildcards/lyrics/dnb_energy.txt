[Verse 1] {City lights blur into streaks of gold, the night is young and the air is cold. I feel the pavement humming beneath my feet, syncing up with the rhythm of the street.|Concrete jungle breathing in the smoke, waiting for the silence finally to be broke. The pressure building in the underground, chasing the echo of a future sound.|Waking up as the sun goes down, the only living soul in this ghost town. I got a fire burning in my chest, putting the system to the final test.|Rolling deep where the shadows play, hiding from the light of the coming day. The frequency is rising in the air, electric static tangling in my hair.|Step into the motion, lose the past, living in a moment that won't last. The world is spinning at a different speed, satisfying every single need.|Liquid dreams in a crystal glass, watching all the heavy moments pass. The melody is drifting like a ghost, raising a glass to what we lost the most.|Darkness creeping in the alleyway, nothing left for us to do or say. The bassline growling like a beast inside, there is no place left for us to hide.|Accelerate until the vision blurs, the engine of the city purrs. We are the passengers of time and space, disappearing without a single trace.|Soft piano notes on a heavy break, wondering how much more that we can take. The contrast cuts right to the bone, a crowded room but we are all alone.|Signal flickering on the radio, telling me exactly where to go. The coordinates are set for overdrive, the only way to feel alive.|Walking fast through the neon rain, washing away the memory of pain. The snare drum snapping like a whip, don't let the rhythm start to slip.|Eyes wide open in the strobe light flash, waiting for the cymbal and the heavy crash. The energy is spiking off the chart, a direct line to the beating heart.|Sub-frequencies beneath the floor, kicking down the metal door. We're locking in, we're never letting go, moving fast and taking it slow.|Atmosphere is heavy, thick and sweet, moving to the tempo of the street. A thousand voices calling out your name, but everything just sounds the same.|Lost inside the loop, a perfect circle, leaping over every single hurdle. The finish line is just a state of mind, leaving all the baggage far behind.|Reflections in the window of the train, speeding through the tunnels of my brain. The graffiti blurring into art, a masterpiece of a broken heart.|Silence before the storm begins to break, every single move is ours to make. The tension wires are pulling tight, ready to explode into the night.|Gritty textures on a polished soul, losing every ounce of self-control. The dirty bass is cleaning up the mess, the only answer is a strong, hard yes.|Floating on a wave of pure sound, feet are barely touching off the ground. The gravity is failing everywhere, floating like a feather in the air.|Tech-noir visions in a cyber-haze, trapped inside a digital maze. The algorithm set the beat, shuffling the rhythm of our feet.|Sunrise waiting on the other side, nowhere left for shadows to hide. But we still have a thousand miles to go, flowing like a river, deep and slow.|Heart rate syncing with the BPM, finding the flaw in the stratagem. We're hacking into the mainframe now, wiping the sweat from the furrowed brow.|Voices whispering in the reverb tail, wind is catching in the solar sail. We're voyaging across the sonic sea, breaking the chains and running free.|Urban decay turning into dust, crumbling iron and the smell of rust. But underneath the flowers start to bloom, clearing out the endless sense of gloom.|Synths are soaring like a bird of prey, hunting down the worries of the day. The talons dig into the melody, carrying us to where we want to be.|Grey skies turning into silver linings, deciphering the mystic divinings. The oracle is speaking through the drum, telling us the promised kingdom has come.|Stepping stones across a rushing stream, waking up inside a lucid dream. The water rushing fast and cold, a story that has never been told.|Filters sweeping low to high, watching the equalizer hit the sky. The modulation twisting up the sound, burying the anchor in the ground.|Ghost notes playing in the spaces in between, the unseen players of the vibrant scene. You feel them more than you can hear, whispering the secrets in your ear.|Vibrations rattling the ribcage bones, sitting on the speaker like a throne. The king of sound is holding court, in this electric, rhythmic fort.|Red lights flashing in the danger zone, picking up the red emergency phone. The warning sirens start to wail, but we are soaring off the rail.|Clockwork mechanisms spinning round, gears are grinding with a heavy sound. The industrial machine is alive, fighting for the simple will to survive.|Velvet textures on a rough terrain, pleasure mixing in with all the pain. The dichotomy of the human soul, playing its essential role.|Looking back at where we used to be, a faded photograph of you and me. But the rhythm pushes us ahead, resurrecting memories from the dead.|A soulful sample from a bygone age, trapped inside a digital cage. We set it free to sing again, washing away the sorrow and the pain.|High hats ticking like a time bomb clock, waiting for the final shell shock. The countdown started long ago, moving fast and moving slow.|Shadow boxing with the silhouette, dripping with the fever and the sweat. The opponent is the mirror image, caught inside a sonic skirmish.|Bass faces pulling in the dark, lightning striking, creating a spark. The voltage jumping across the gap, caught inside the thunder clap.|Rolling papers and the smell of green, painting the air a hazy scene. The smoke rings drifting to the roof, searching for the absolute proof.|Laser beams cutting through the haze, setting the atmosphere ablaze. The photons dancing in the dark, finding the target, hitting the mark.|Rewind selector, bring it back, staying on the straight and narrow track. The DJ is the pilot of the plane, flying through the hurricane.|Soulful diva with a voice of gold, stories of the future being told. The harmony is lifting up the room, chasing away the impending doom.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Can you feel the pressure rising up? We're overflowing from the cup. The limit line is broken now, wipe the sweat from off your brow.|Faster than the speed of light, tearing through the fabric of the night. Hold on tight and don't let go, we're about to steal the show.|The drop is coming, can you feel the fear? The moment of truth is finally here. Brace yourself for the impact zone, chilling you right to the bone.|Build it up and break it down, the heavy king is wearing the crown. The dynasty of sound is here, making everything crystal clear.|Frequency is getting high, oscillating in the silver sky. The wavelength stretching out so far, reaching for the furthest star.|Heartbeat racing like a train, adrenaline inside the vein. The chemical reaction starts, connecting all the broken hearts.|Wait for it, the signal's clear, everything you want is here. The anticipation creates the heat, moving from your head to feet.|Silence falls before the storm, the air is getting thick and warm. The calm before the hurricane, unleashing all the stored-up pain.|One, seven, four, the tempo lock, ticking like a master clock. The universal rhythm code, driving down the open road.|Breathe it in and let it out, removing every single doubt. The clarity is sharp and bright, guiding us into the light.|Spinning faster, out of control, the music taking final toll. Surrender to the surging weight, accepted by the hands of fate.|Rising up like a tidal wave, coming here to crush and save. The ocean of the sound is deep, promises we have to keep.|Tension tightens like a wire, setting the atmosphere on fire. The spark is jumping to the fuse, nothing left for us to lose.|Eyes are closed, hands in the air, vanishing without a care. The physical is left behind, traveling inside the mind.|Modulation starts to twist, appearing through the silver mist. The shape of sound is changing form, weathering the final, coming storm.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Let the bassline roll, lose control. Feel the rhythm deep in your soul. We are running, we are flying, never stopping, never dying.|It's the drum and bass, setting the pace. Disappearing without a trace. In the city, in the dark, lighting up the vital spark.|High energy, setting us free. This is where we want to be. The vibration, the sensation, rocking the entire nation.|Liquid gold, stories told. Brave and new and strong and bold. Smooth and easy, rough and hard, playing the final trump card.|Neurofunk, heavy junk. Sunken ship and deep sea dunk. Grimy, dirty, nasty, mean, the filthiest sound you've ever seen.|Jump up high, touch the sky. Never asking the reason why. Bouncing, shaking, moving fast, making the good feelings last.|Intelligent, sentiment. Heaven sent and decadent. Atmospherics, space and time, the perfect rhythm and the rhyme.|Roll the drums, here it comes. Numbing all your fingers and thumbs. The impact hitting like a wall, standing up and standing tall.|Speed of sound, underground. The treasure that we finally found. Gold and diamonds in the rough, we can never get enough.|Bass drop, never stop. Rising to the mountain top. The view is clear from up above, filled with peace and filled with love.|Amen break, make it shake. Everything is now at stake. The classic rhythm, old and new, pushing all the way through.|Reese bass, outer space. Winning the eternal race. The texture tearing through the air, leaving nothing standing there.|Ghost kick, moving slick. The magic of the conjuring trick. Now you see it, now you don't, saying you will when you won't.|Snare snap, thunder clap. Caught inside the honey trap. Sharp and cutting, clean and bright, slicing through the neon night.|Wobble low, heavy blow. The undertow is moving slow. Pulling you beneath the wave, deeper into the sonic cave.}

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2] {Second wind is kicking in, shedding off the second skin. The metamorphosis is done, the revolution has begun.|Deep inside the pocket now, wiping the sweat from off the brow. The groove is locked and loaded tight, burning through the middle night.|Tunnel vision, straight ahead, remembering what the prophet said. The music is the only cure, keeping the intention pure.|Echoes bouncing off the wall, answering the siren call. The reverb tail is long and wide, a cavern where the secrets hide.|Glitching out the interface, stepping out of time and space. The digital is bleeding through, turning everything to blue.|Organic drums and synth machines, creating brand new movie scenes. The soundtrack to a life of speed, planting the rhythmic, vital seed.|Samples chopped and screwed and bent, wondering where the time went. The collage of a fractured mind, leaving logic far behind.|White noise sweeping like the wind, forgiving every single sin. The static cleans the mental slate, opening the final gate.|Polyrhythms clashing hard, playing in the dusty junkyard. The chaos has a perfect form, the center of the quiet storm.|Vocals floating in the mix, getting the daily sonic fix. The siren song is sweet and low, telling us which way to go.|Double time, half the speed, planting the erratic, random seed. The time signature starts to drift, creating a tectonic shift.|Bass weight heavy on the chest, putting the stamina to test. The lungs are burning, legs are weak, but we are still climbing the peak.|Stutter step and glitchy beat, moving on the concrete street. The pavement is a dance floor now, showing the people exactly how.|Pad sounds swelling like the sea, washing over you and me. The chord progression sad and deep, promises we couldn't keep.|Arpeggios are climbing high, reaching for the open sky. The notes are falling like the rain, washing away the heavy stain.|Distortion on the master bus, causing a chaotic fuss. The grit is adding character, blurring the line and the blur.|Feedback loops are screaming loud, rising above the heavy cloud. The noise is music to the ear, chasing away the sudden fear.|Sidechain pumping, breathing deep, waking up from endless sleep. The pulse is linked to the kick, the heartbeat of the lunatic.|Harmonies are stacking up, filling the overflowing cup. The chord is major, then it's minor, nothing could be any finer.|Resonance is peaking sharp, plucking the electric harp. The filter sweep is cutting through, painting the picture in blue.}

[Bridge] {Binary code raining down, zeroes and ones without a sound. The matrix is revealing its face, showing us our proper place.|We are the children of the night, feeding on electric light. The cables running through our veins, powering our hopes and pains.|Suspend the laws of gravity, embracing the depravity. Of motion without consequence, living in the present tense.|No yesterday, no tomorrow, just the now we beg and borrow. Time is just a flat circle here, spinning without end or fear.|Feel the vibration in your bones, ancient rhythms, modern tones. The fusion is complete at last, connecting future with the past.|We are the signal in the noise, speaking with a thousand voices. The message is simple and clear, the revolution is finally here.}

[Instrumental]

[Outro] {Fading out into the grey, living to fight another day. The echo lingers in the mind, leaving the heavy world behind.|The lights go up, the music stops. The final heavy needle drops. We walk out into morning air, breathless and without a care.|Ringing ears and heavy feet, walking down the silent street. The city is waking up again, the cycle of the sun and rain.|Silence is a heavy friend, waiting at the very end. But in the quiet, we can hear, the rhythm ringing loud and clear.|One seven four, forevermore. Walking through the open door. The tempo of a beating heart, a perfect place for us to start.|Fade to black, disconnect. Showing the rhythm some respect. The service is terminated now, take a final, sweeping bow.|Static on the radio, nowhere left for us to go. The signal is fading in the noise, put away the broken toys.|Ghost in the machine is dead, silence in the heavy head. The bass is sleeping in the wood, misunderstood but understood.|Drifting off to sleep at last, dreaming of the future past. The rhythm rocking us to sleep, secrets that we have to keep.|The sun is rising in the east, taming the nocturnal beast. The vampires hiding from the light, waiting for another night.}

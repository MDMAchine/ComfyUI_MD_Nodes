[Verse 1] {The walls are breathing in and out, removing every shadow of a doubt. The colors melting on the floor, opening the heavy perception door.|Fractals spinning in the mind, leaving the logic far behind. The geometry is sacred geometry, setting the captive spirit free.|Kaleidoscope eyes, vision blur, trying to remember the smell of her. But she is just a concept now, wipe the sweat from off the brow.|Vibrations rising from the ground, a buzzing and electric sound. The frequency is tuning in, shedding off the human skin.|Time is a flat circle, round and round, burying the anchor in the ground. The past, the present, and the future merge, standing on the heavy cosmic verge.|Machine elves dancing on the shelf, talking to the heavy self. The wisdom of the universe, removing the heavy ancient curse.|Ego death, dissolving fast, making the heavy moment last. The "I" is gone, the "We" remains, breaking the heavy mental chains.|Colors that don't have a name, playing the universal game. The spectrum is infinite and wide, nowhere left to run and hide.|Telepathic signals sent, wondering where the time went. The thoughts are loud and crystal clear, removing every trace of fear.|Levitating off the bed, getting out of the heavy head. The astral plane is open wide, enjoy the heavy magic ride.|Talking to the plants and trees, floating on the gentle breeze. The nature spirit speaking loud, rising above the heavy cloud.|Synesthesia, taste the sound, picking yourself off the ground. The music is a flavor sweet, shuffling on the concrete street.|Mirror world, reflection wrong, singing the heavy siren song. The duplicate is staring back, staying on the winding track.|Melting clocks and liquid space, looking at a stranger's face. The reality is dripping down, drowning the heavy little town.|Third eye opening, bright and white, burning through the middle of the night. The pineal gland is active now, wipe the sweat from off the brow.|Patterns in the carpet crawl, writing on the heavy wall. The message is a cryptic code, driving down the open road.|Looping thought, recursive dream, bursting at the heavy seam. The paradox is taking hold, turning the heavy lead to gold.|Alien abduction beam, living inside the fever dream. The spaceship landing on the lawn, waiting for the heavy dawn.|Chanting monks in a distant land, holding the heavy universe in hand. The vibration is a healing thing, making the heavy spirit sing.|Shaman dancing in the fire, climbing the heavy funeral pyre. The smoke is clearing out the mind, leaving the heavy world behind.|Mushroom forest, giant size, looking into the future's eyes. The Alice in Wonderland effect, showing the rhythm some respect.|Laser beams of pure love, raining down from up above. The connection is direct and true, connecting me and connecting you.|Digital rain, matrix code, walking down the heavy road. The simulation is revealed, the heavy fate is finally sealed.|Cosmic joke, laughing hard, playing in the backyard. The punchline is the life we live, giving all we have to give.|Spiral staircase going down, underneath the heavy town. The rabbit hole is deep and dark, lighting up the vital spark.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Can you feel the vibration? The cosmic sensation. The atoms are shaking apart, connecting the heavy broken heart.|Higher, higher, lift off. Suppressing the heavy cough. The atmosphere is leaving fast, making the heavy moment last.|Spinning, turning, twisting round. Buried deep in the ground. The vortex is pulling us in, shedding off the second skin.|Breathe in the light, breathe out the dark. Lighting the heavy vital spark. The energy is pure and clean, the weirdest thing you've ever seen.|Close your eyes and see the sound. Picking yourself off the ground. The visualizer in the brain, washing away the heavy pain.}

[Chorus] {Psychedelic state of mind, leaving the heavy world behind. Traveling through inner space, disappearing without a trace.|Tripping on the heavy beat, shuffling on the concrete street. The hallucination is real, the only thing we truly feel.|Open up the third eye, reaching for the open sky. The vision is clear and bright, burning through the endless night.|Trance state, meditation. Rocking the entire nation. The rhythm is a mantra deep, promises we have to keep.|Colors exploding in the air, vanishing without a care. The fireworks of the soul, making the broken spirit whole.|Dissolve the ego, kill the self. Putting the trophy on the shelf. We are one with everything, making the heavy spirit sing.|Goa trance, psybient. Heaven sent and decadent. The rhythm of the universe, removing the heavy ancient curse.|Fractal pattern, infinite loop. Eating the heavy cosmic soup. The design is perfect and precise, rolling the heavy sonic dice.|Mind expansion, consciousness. Getting us out of this mess. The awareness is growing fast, making the heavy moment last.|Acid techno, liquid sound. Burying the anchor in the ground. The texture twisting through the air, leaving nothing standing there.}

[Bridge] {The floor is lava, the sky is green. The weirdest thing I've ever seen. The rules of physics don't apply, reaching for the open sky.|Time dilation, slowing down. The quietest sound in the town. A second lasts for an hour or more, kicking down the heavy door.|Voices speaking in reverse, removing the heavy ancient curse. The message is hard to understand, traveling to a distant land.|Geometric shapes align, crossing the heavy yellow line. The structure of the soul is clear, removing every single fear.|Floating in the void alone, sitting on the speaker throne. The silence is the loudest thing, making the heavy spirit sing.}

[Outro] {Coming down, landing soft. Lofting the heavy spirit aloft. The journey is ending for now, take a final, sweeping bow.|The colors fade to grey and white, vanishing into the night. But the memory is burned in deep, secrets that we have to keep.|Reality is snapping back, staying on the winding track. The walls stop breathing, floor is still, bending to the breaking of the will.|Integrate the lesson learned, the heavy bridges that were burned. The wisdom of the trip remains, breaking the heavy mental chains.|Sleep now, psychonaut. The battle that was heavily fought. The dream world waits for you again, remembering the way and when.}

[Verse 1] {The walls are breathing in and out, removing every shadow of a doubt. The colors melting on the floor, opening the wide perception door.|Fractals spinning in the mind, leaving the rigid logic far behind. The geometry is sacred and pure, the only medicine and the only cure.|Kaleidoscope eyes, vision blur, trying to remember the smell of her. But she is just a concept now, wipe the sweat from off the brow.|Vibrations rising from the ground, a buzzing and electric sound. The frequency is tuning in, shedding off the human skin.|Time is a flat circle, round and round, burying the anchor in the ground. The past, the present, and the future merge, standing on the cosmic verge.|Machine elves dancing on the shelf, talking to the quiet, inner self. The wisdom of the universe, removing the weight of the ancient curse.|Ego death, dissolving fast, making the final moment last. The "I" is gone, the "We" remains, breaking the brittle mental chains.|Colors that don't have a name, playing the universal game. The spectrum is infinite and wide, nowhere left to run and hide.|Telepathic signals sent, wondering where the long hours went. The thoughts are loud and crystal clear, removing every trace of fear.|Levitating off the bed, getting out of the restless head. The astral plane is open wide, enjoy the silent, magic ride.|Talking to the plants and trees, floating on the gentle breeze. The nature spirit speaking loud, rising above the digital cloud.|Synesthesia, taste the sound, picking yourself up off the ground. The music is a flavor sweet, shuffling on the concrete street.|Mirror world, reflection wrong, singing the strange siren song. The duplicate is staring back, staying on the winding track.|Melting clocks and liquid space, looking at a stranger's face. The reality is dripping down, drowning the empty little town.|Third eye opening, bright and white, burning through the middle of the night. The pineal gland is active now, wipe the sweat from off the brow.|Patterns in the carpet crawl, writing on the cold bathroom wall. The message is a cryptic code, driving down the open road.|Looping thought, recursive dream, bursting at the digital seam. The paradox is taking hold, turning the simple lead to gold.|Alien abduction beam, living inside the fever dream. The spaceship landing on the lawn, waiting for the sudden dawn.|Chanting monks in a distant land, holding the universe in hand. The vibration is a healing thing, making the inner spirit sing.|Shaman dancing in the fire, climbing the final funeral pyre. The smoke is clearing out the mind, leaving the mortal world behind.|Mushroom forest, giant size, looking into the future's eyes. The Alice in Wonderland effect, showing the rhythm some respect.|Laser beams of pure love, raining down from up above. The connection is direct and true, connecting me and connecting you.|Digital rain, matrix code, walking down the long, empty road. The simulation is revealed, the final fate is finally sealed.|Cosmic joke, laughing hard, playing in the open backyard. The punchline is the life we live, giving all we have to give.|Spiral staircase going down, underneath the silent town. The rabbit hole is deep and dark, lighting up the vital spark.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Can you feel the vibration? The cosmic sensation. The atoms are shaking apart, connecting the broken heart.|Higher, higher, lift off. Suppressing the final cough. The atmosphere is leaving fast, making the final moment last.|Spinning, turning, twisting round. Buried deep in the solid ground. The vortex is pulling us in, shedding off the second skin.|Breathe in the light, breathe out the dark. Lighting the inner vital spark. The energy is pure and clean, the weirdest thing you've ever seen.|Close your eyes and see the sound. Picking yourself up off the ground. The visualizer in the brain, washing away the surging pain.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Psychedelic state of mind, leaving the dull world behind. Traveling through inner space, disappearing without a trace.|Tripping on the constant beat, shuffling on the concrete street. The hallucination is real, the only thing we truly feel.|Open up the third eye, reaching for the open sky. The vision is clear and bright, burning through the endless night.|Trance state, meditation. Rocking the entire nation. The rhythm is a mantra deep, promises we have to keep.|Colors exploding in the air, vanishing without a care. The fireworks of the soul, making the broken spirit whole.|Dissolve the ego, kill the self. Putting the trophy on the shelf. We are one with everything, making the inner spirit sing.|Goa trance, psybient. Heaven sent and decadent. The rhythm of the universe, removing the grip of the ancient curse.|Fractal pattern, infinite loop. Eating the strange cosmic soup. The design is perfect and precise, rolling the final sonic dice.|Mind expansion, consciousness. Getting us out of this mess. The awareness is growing fast, making the final moment last.|Acid techno, liquid sound. Burying the anchor in the ground. The texture twisting through the air, leaving nothing standing there.}

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2] {Entity contact, interdimensional meet, ancient beings taking their seat. They speak in languages beyond words, songs of the celestial birds.|Morphing faces in the crowd, each one screaming, each one loud. The multiplying, dividing forms, reality performing metamorphic storms.|Breathing floors and melting doors, breaking all the natural laws. The architecture comes alive, pulsing with the will to survive.|Auras visible to the naked eye, rainbow halos, no need to try. The energy fields are plain to see, the true form of you and me.|Body disintegrating, floating away, particles dispersing into cosmic spray. No fear in the dissolution, just acceptance of the resolution.|Sacred symbols appearing in the air, ancient alphabets everywhere. The language of creation revealed, every secret finally unsealed.|Déjà vu on infinite repeat, every moment bittersweet. The feeling that you've been here before, standing at this exact same door.|Plants communicating their ancient knowledge, nature's own mystical college. The ivy speaking of time and growth, the flowers whispering their sacred oath.|Experiencing multiple timelines at once, feeling brilliant yet feeling like dunce. Parallel realities bleeding through, showing the many versions of you.|Mandala visions spinning fast, present, future, and the past. The circular patterns holding keys, to understanding all mysteries.|Ancestors visiting from the other side, their presence impossible to hide. Guidance from the ones who came before, opening up another door.|Childhood memories playing back, film reel running off the track. Seeing life from outside the frame, realizing it's all just a game.|Every cell vibrating at high frequency, microscopic cosmic symphony. The body is a universe contained, billions of stars interconnected and chained.|Witnessing the birth and death of galaxies, collapsing and expanding with ease. The cosmic cycle on display, creation and destruction in eternal play.|Understanding universal connection, seeing beyond simple reflection. The web that links all living things, invisible threads and cosmic strings.|Experiencing eternity in a moment, time becoming just a component. Malleable, stretchable, not concrete, rhythm without a beat.|Communicating without speaking, just being and just seeking. The telepathic resonance clear, message transmitted without fear.|Revisiting the moment of your birth, understanding your purpose and worth. The reason for incarnation revealed, the contract finally unsealed.|Feeling the Earth's consciousness awake, every move the planet makes. The breathing of the world so clear, Gaia's heartbeat in your ear.|Technological visions of the future, humanity's high-tech suture. Merging man and machine as one, evolution that's just begun.|Understanding death is just a door, not an ending, something more. Transitioning between different states, accepting all the given fates.|Witnessing your own funeral scene, understanding what it all means. The body empty, spirit free, dancing in infinity.|Connecting with plant intelligence, feeling their ancient benevolence. The teachers showing you the way, what they've tried to always say.}

[Bridge] {The floor is lava, the sky is green. The weirdest thing I've ever seen. The rules of physics don't apply, reaching for the open sky.|Time dilation, slowing down. The quietest sound in the town. A second lasts for an hour or more, kicking down the solid door.|Voices speaking in reverse, removing the ancient curse. The message is hard to understand, traveling to a distant land.|Geometric shapes align, crossing the bright yellow line. The structure of the soul is clear, removing every trace of fear.|Floating in the void alone, sitting on the speaker throne. The silence is the loudest thing, making the pure spirit sing.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {Psychedelic state of mind, leaving the dull world behind. Traveling through inner space, disappearing without a trace.|Tripping on the constant beat, shuffling on the concrete street. The hallucination is real, the only thing we truly feel.|Open up the third eye, reaching for the open sky. The vision is clear and bright, burning through the endless night.|Trance state, meditation. Rocking the entire nation. The rhythm is a mantra deep, promises we have to keep.|Colors exploding in the air, vanishing without a care. The fireworks of the soul, making the broken spirit whole.|Dissolve the ego, kill the self. Putting the trophy on the shelf. We are one with everything, making the inner spirit sing.|Goa trance, psybient. Heaven sent and decadent. The rhythm of the universe, removing the grip of the ancient curse.|Fractal pattern, infinite loop. Eating the strange cosmic soup. The design is perfect and precise, rolling the final sonic dice.|Mind expansion, consciousness. Getting us out of this mess. The awareness is growing fast, making the final moment last.|Acid techno, liquid sound. Burying the anchor in the ground. The texture twisting through the air, leaving nothing standing there.}

[Outro] {Coming down, landing soft. Lifting the weary spirit aloft. The journey is ending for now, take a final, sweeping bow.|The colors fade to grey and white, vanishing into the night. But the memory is burned in deep, secrets that we have to keep.|Reality is snapping back, staying on the winding track. The walls stop breathing, floor is still, bending to the breaking of the will.|Integrate the lesson learned, the brittle bridges that were burned. The wisdom of the trip remains, breaking the painful mental chains.|Sleep now, psychonaut. The battle that was bravely fought. The dream world waits for you again, remembering the way and when.}

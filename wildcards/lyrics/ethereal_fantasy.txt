[Verse 1] {The mist is rising from the emerald lake, A silent promise that we dare not break. The ancient trees are whispering our names, A secret language consumed by silver flames.|Walking barefoot on the mossy stone, Entering a kingdom we have always known. The starlight filters through the canopy, illuminating you and illuminating me.|Beneath the surface of the waking world, A hidden banner suddenly unfurled. We are the dreamers of the ancient dream, Floating gently down the silver stream.|The mountain peaks are crowned in winter white, Guarding the valleys through the endless night. The wind is singing songs of olden days, Lost inside the mystical and violet haze.|A crystal castle in the clouds above, Built on a foundation of eternal love. We climb the stairs of glass and frozen air, Leaving behind the sorrow and the care.|The moon is watching with a mother's eye, A silver coin suspended in the sky. The tides are pulling at the sleeping soul, Making the fragmented spirit whole.|Softly spoken words upon the breeze, Carrying the secrets of the seven seas. We listen closely to the siren call, Catching us before we start to fall.|Golden leaves are falling to the ground, Covering the silence with a rustling sound. The seasons change but we remain the same, Keepers of the sacred, endless flame.|Shadows dancing in the faerie ring, Listening to the creatures start to sing. The magic is alive and well tonight, Bathed in the soft and pale moonlight.|Reflections in the water clear and deep, Secrets that the willow trees will keep. We gaze into the mirror of the past, Wondering how long the gentle spell will last.|The stars align in patterns in the dark, Lighting up the universal spark. We are connected to the cosmic dust, Placing in the universe our trust.|Velvet robes and crowns of woven flowers, Whiling away the golden, magic hours. The time is fluid, flowing like a stream, Waking up inside a waking dream.|Voices calling from the other side, Where the ancient spirits run and hide. We cross the bridge of fog and morning dew, Starting life entirely anew.|The garden blooms with roses red and white, Glowing softly in the fading light. The scent of jasmine hangs in the air, Vanishing without a single care.|Nebula swirling in the velvet black, There is no map, there is no turning back. We voyage to the center of the soul, Losing every ounce of self-control.|Gregorian chants echo in the hall, Bouncing off the cold and stony wall. The harmony is holy and pure, The only medicine and the only cure.|Glacier moving slow across the land, Carving out the future with a cold hand. The ice is singing songs of deep despair, Freezing the breath within the winter air.|Lanterns floating on the dark lagoon, Underneath the watchful eye of the moon. Wishes sent upon a paper boat, Keeping the gentle hope afloat.|The phoenix rises from the bed of ash, In a sudden, blinding, golden flash. Reborn into a world of fire and light, Burning through the middle of the night.|Sapphire eyes and skin of porcelain, Where does the story end and where begin? The fairytale is real and alive, The only way that we can survive.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Can you hear the whisper in the wind? Calling us to where we haven't been. The portal opens, shimmering and bright, Stepping into pure and endless light.|Levitate above the solid ground, Silence is the only constant sound. Weightless body, weightless simple heart, Ready for the great journey to start.|The veil is thinning, tearing at the seam, Waking from the miserable human dream. The other world is bleeding into this, Sealed with a cold and quiet kiss.|Spirits rising from the hollow earth, Celebrating moments of rebirth. The ancestors are standing in a row, Watching the deep river flow.|Close your eyes and let the vision in, Shedding off the mortal, human skin. Transcending boundaries of time and space, Disappearing without a trace.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {We are the children of the stars and dust, In the universe we place our trust. Floating on the ether, wild and free, Exactly where we are supposed to be.|Eternal light, shine upon the way, Turning the darkness into bright day. The path is golden, leading to the sun, The journey has only just begun.|Mystic river, carry us away, To a place where we can safely stay. Beyond the mountains and the purple sky, Where the spirit never has to die.|Celestial harmony, ring out loud, Lifting us above the common cloud. The choir of the angels singing sweet, Resting at the great master's feet.|Dreamscape lover, hold me in the dark, Lighting up the deep, vital spark. In this dimension, we are kings and queens, Living in the spaces in betweens.|Galaxies are spinning in your eyes, No more secrets, no more empty lies. The truth is written in the cosmic code, Walking down the long and winding road.|Ethereal beauty, fading in the mist, The lips that the silent angel kissed. A memory of heaven on the earth, The moment of the sacred second birth.|Sacred geometry, shapes of light, Burning through the middle of the night. The pattern is the answer to it all, Catching us before we start to fall.|Sanctuary, holy and divine, Turning the water into mystic wine. The miracle is happening right now, Wipe the sweat from off the furrowed brow.|Infinite horizon, stretching far, Wishing on a bright and falling star. The destination doesn't matter much, Just the healing of the gentle touch.}

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2] {Crystal caverns deep beneath the earth, The womb from which all magic finds its birth. Stalactites dripping mineral tears, Echoing the whispers of a thousand years.|Unicorns are grazing in the meadow green, The purest, most majestic thing I've ever seen. Their horns are glowing with celestial power, Blessing every creature, every leaf and flower.|Dragon sleeping in the mountain cave, Guardian of the treasure and the brave. The scales are shimmering like precious gems, Ancient wisdom flowing from the dragon's hymns.|Mermaids singing in the coral reef, Their haunting melodies beyond belief. The ocean carries their enchanted song, A place where broken hearts can still belong.|Wizards casting spells of silver light, Weaving magic through the velvet night. The incantations written in the stars, Healing every wound and every scar.|Elven archers in the forest deep, Protectors of the promises we keep. Their arrows fly with supernatural grace, Defending this enchanted, sacred space.|Fairy dust is sparkling in the air, Sprinkling magic wishes everywhere. The tiny wings are humming soft and low, Making flowers bloom and rivers flow.|Pegasus ascending to the sky, Wings spread wide as it begins to fly. The clouds are parting for its noble flight, Soaring through dimensions of pure light.|Griffins perched upon the castle tower, Watching over us with ancient power. Half eagle, half lion, fierce and true, Guardians of the old ways and the new.|Centaurs running through the silver glade, Warriors and poets, unafraid. The hoofbeats thunder like a drumming heart, Where nature and nobility never part.|Witches brewing potions in the night, Mixing darkness with celestial light. The cauldron bubbling with mystic steam, Manifesting every lucid dream.|Sprites are dancing in the morning dew, Painting rainbows in shades of every hue. Their laughter tinkling like silver bells, Breaking the ordinary's mundane spells.|Talking animals with wisdom old, Stories that have never yet been told. The fox, the owl, the raven black, Guiding wanderers on their sacred track.|Enchanted forests where the trees can walk, And every creature has the gift to talk. The language of the earth is spoken here, A dialect of love without any fear.|Prophets writing in the book of fate, Standing at the universal gate. The future and the past collapse as one, Beneath the ever-present mystic sun.|Giants waking from their ancient sleep, Rising from the mountains dark and deep. Their footsteps shake the very ground we stand, Reshaping all the contours of the land.|Nymphs emerging from the waterfall, Answering the primal nature's call. Their beauty is beyond what words can say, Turning ordinary night to magical day.|Oracle speaking in the sacred grove, Prophecies of wisdom, hope, and love. The future written in the shifting sand, Understood by those who comprehend.|Shape-shifters changing with the moon's bright phase, Morphing through a thousand different ways. The fluid form reflects the soul within, Where endings transform and new lives begin.|Time travelers walking through the mist, Visiting every moment that exists. Past and future bleeding into now, Teaching us exactly why and how.}

[Bridge] {The spell is cast, the circle is complete, Resting at the great master's feet. The magic binds us with a silver thread, resurrecting spirits from the dead.|Time stands still, the clock has ceased to tick, The air is getting warmer, soft and thick. Suspended in a moment out of time, The perfect rhythm and the perfect rhyme.|Dimensions folding, overlapping space, Staring at the silent angel's face. The reality we knew is gone, Waiting for the gentle break of the dawn.|Silence is a language we can speak, The strong are protecting the fragile weak. No words are needed in this holy place, Just the look upon the quiet face.|Drifting deeper into the unknown, Sitting on the cold crystal throne. The kingdom is inside the quiet mind, Leaving the material world behind.}

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] {We are the children of the stars and dust, In the universe we place our trust. Floating on the ether, wild and free, Exactly where we are supposed to be.|Eternal light, shine upon the way, Turning the darkness into bright day. The path is golden, leading to the sun, The journey has only just begun.|Mystic river, carry us away, To a place where we can safely stay. Beyond the mountains and the purple sky, Where the spirit never has to die.|Celestial harmony, ring out loud, Lifting us above the common cloud. The choir of the angels singing sweet, Resting at the great master's feet.|Dreamscape lover, hold me in the dark, Lighting up the deep, vital spark. In this dimension, we are kings and queens, Living in the spaces in betweens.|Galaxies are spinning in your eyes, No more secrets, no more empty lies. The truth is written in the cosmic code, Walking down the long and winding road.|Ethereal beauty, fading in the mist, The lips that the silent angel kissed. A memory of heaven on the earth, The moment of the sacred second birth.|Sacred geometry, shapes of light, Burning through the middle of the night.

The miracle is happening right now, Wipe the sweat from off the furrowed brow.|Infinite horizon, stretching far, Wishing on a bright and falling star. The destination doesn't matter much, Just the healing of the gentle touch.}

[Outro] {Fading out into stardust and to light, Vanishing into the endless night. The dream is over but the memory stays, Guiding us through all our days.|The portal closes, sealing us inside, Nowhere left for us to run and hide. We are the guardians of the silent gate, Accepted by the hands of fate.|Whispers fading, silence returning now, Wipe the sweat from off the quiet brow. The magic lingers in the morning air, Vanishing without a single care.|Return to earth, return to quiet clay, Living to fight another day. But in the heart the magic ever lives, The only comfort that it gives.|Sleep now, dreamer, close your quiet eyes, Ignore the foolish telling of the lies. The truth is waiting in the silent sleep, Secrets that the dreaming angels keep.}

[Verse 1] {The mist is rising from the emerald lake, A silent promise that we dare not break. The ancient trees are whispering our names, A secret language consumed by silver flames.|Walking barefoot on the mossy stone, Entering a kingdom we have always known. The starlight filters through the canopy, illuminating you and illuminating me.|Beneath the surface of the waking world, A hidden banner suddenly unfurled. We are the dreamers of the ancient dream, Floating gently down the silver stream.|The mountain peaks are crowned in winter white, Guarding the valleys through the endless night. The wind is singing songs of olden days, Lost inside the mystical and violet haze.|A crystal castle in the clouds above, Built on a foundation of eternal love. We climb the stairs of glass and frozen air, Leaving behind the heavy world of care.|The moon is watching with a mother's eye, A silver coin suspended in the sky. The tides are pulling at the sleeping soul, Making the fragmented spirit whole.|Softly spoken words upon the breeze, Carrying the secrets of the seven seas. We listen closely to the siren call, Catching us before we start to fall.|Golden leaves are falling to the ground, Covering the silence with a rustling sound. The seasons change but we remain the same, Keepers of the the eternal, sacred flame.|Shadows dancing in the faerie ring, Listening to the creatures start to sing. The magic is alive and well tonight, Bathed in the soft and pale moonlight.|Reflections in the water clear and deep, Secrets that the willow trees will keep. We gaze into the mirror of the past, Wondering how long the spell will last.|The stars align in patterns in the dark, Lighting up the universal spark. We are connected to the cosmic dust, Placing in the universe our trust.|Velvet robes and crowns of woven flowers, Whiling away the golden, magic hours. The time is fluid, flowing like a stream, Waking up inside a waking dream.|Voices calling from the other side, Where the ancient spirits run and hide. We cross the bridge of fog and morning dew, Starting life entirely anew.|The garden blooms with roses red and white, Glowing softly in the fading light. The scent of jasmine heavy in the air, Vanishing without a single care.|Nebula swirling in the velvet black, There is no map, there is no turning back. We voyage to the center of the soul, Losing every ounce of self-control.|Gregorian chants echo in the hall, Bouncing off the ancient, stony wall. The harmony is holy and pure, The only medicine and the only cure.|Glacier moving slow across the land, Carving out the future with a cold hand. The ice is singing songs of deep despair, Freezing the breath within the winter air.|Lanterns floating on the dark lagoon, Underneath the watching of the moon. Wishes sent upon a paper boat, Keeping the fragile hope afloat.|The phoenix rises from the bed of ash, In a sudden, blinding, golden flash. Reborn into a world of fire and light, Burning through the middle of the night.|Sapphire eyes and skin of porcelain, Where does the story end and where begin? The fairytale is real and alive, The only way that we can survive.}

[Pre-Chorus] {Can you hear the whisper in the wind? Calling us to where we haven't been. The portal opens, shimmering and bright, Stepping into pure and endless light.|Levitate above the solid ground, Silence is the only heavy sound. Weightless body, weightless heavy heart, Ready for the journey to start.|The veil is thinning, tearing at the seam, Waking from the heavy human dream. The other world is bleeding into this, Sealed with a cold and frozen kiss.|Spirits rising from the hollow earth, Celebrating moments of rebirth. The ancestors are standing in a row, Watching the heavy river flow.|Close your eyes and let the vision in, Shedding off the heavy human skin. Transcending boundaries of time and space, Disappearing without a trace.}

[Chorus] {We are the children of the stars and dust, In the universe we place our trust. Floating on the ether, wild and free, Exactly where we are supposed to be.|Eternal light, shine upon the way, Turning the darkness into bright day. The path is golden, leading to the sun, The journey has only just begun.|Mystic river, carry us away, To a place where we can safely stay. Beyond the mountains and the purple sky, Where the spirit never has to die.|Celestial harmony, ring out loud, Lifting us above the heavy cloud. The choir of the angels singing sweet, Resting at the heavy master's feet.|Dreamscape lover, hold me in the dark, Lighting up the vital, heavy spark. In this dimension, we are kings and queens, Living in the spaces in betweens.|Galaxies are spinning in your eyes, No more secrets, no more heavy lies. The truth is written in the cosmic code, Walking down the long and winding road.|Ethereal beauty, fading in the mist, The lips that the heavy angel kissed. A memory of heaven on the earth, The moment of the heavy second birth.|Sacred geometry, shapes of light, Burning through the middle of the night. The pattern is the answer to it all, Catching us before we start to fall.|Sanctuary, holy and divine, Turning the water into heavy wine. The miracle is happening right now, Wipe the sweat from off the heavy brow.|Infinite horizon, stretching far, Wishing on the heavy falling star. The destination doesn't matter much, Just the healing of the heavy touch.}

[Bridge] {The spell is cast, the circle is complete, Resting at the heavy master's feet. The magic binds us with a silver thread, resurrecting spirits from the dead.|Time stands still, the clock has ceased to tick, The air is getting heavy, warm and thick. Suspended in a moment out of time, The perfect rhythm and the perfect rhyme.|Dimensions folding, overlapping space, Staring at the heavy angel's face. The reality we knew is gone, Waiting for the breaking of the dawn.|Silence is a language we can speak, The strong are protecting the heavy weak. No words are needed in this holy place, Just the look upon the heavy face.|Drifting deeper into the unknown, Sitting on the heavy crystal throne. The kingdom is inside the heavy mind, Leaving the material behind.}

[Outro] {Fading into stardust and to light, Vanishing into the endless night. The dream is over but the memory stays, Guiding us through heavy days.|The portal closes, sealing us inside, Nowhere left for us to run and hide. We are the guardians of the heavy gate, Accepted by the hands of fate.|Whispers fading, silence returning now, Wipe the sweat from off the heavy brow. The magic lingers in the heavy air, Vanishing without a single care.|Return to earth, return to heavy clay, Living to fight another day. But in the heart the magic heavy lives, The only comfort that it gives.|Sleep now, dreamer, close your heavy eyes, Ignore the heavy telling of the lies. The truth is waiting in the heavy sleep, Secrets that the heavy angels keep.}
